		PRELIMINARY REMARKS
The International Committee of the Red Cross has, from the outset, been the
sponsor of the Geneva Convention for the protection of wounded military
personnel, and of the humanitarian Conventions which supplement it. Each
of these fundamental international agreements is inspired by respect for human personality and dignity; together, they establish the principle of disinterested aid to all victims of war without discrimination – to all those who,
whether through wounds, capture or shipwreck, are no longer enemies but
merely suffering and defenceless human beings.
Throughout the years, the International Committee has laboured unremittingly for the greater protection in International Law of the individual against
the hardships of war; it successively elaborated the humanitarian Conventions
and adapted them to current needs, or instituted new ones. In the period
between the two World Wars, the Committee’s main achievement lay in the
establishment of a number of draft Conventions, chief among which was the
Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War; this was signed in the
summer of 1929 and, during the last conflict, protected millions of captives.
Other new or revised draft Conventions were to have been submitted to a
Diplomatic Conference which the Swiss Federal Council planned to convene
early in1940; hostilities, unfortunately, intervened.
The year 1945 marked the close of a war waged on an unprecedented scale; the
task had to be faced of developing and adapting the humanitarian elements
of International Law in the light of the experience gained. The International
Committee’s proposals met with the early approval of Governments and
National Red Cross Societies, and it immediately set to work.
Three former Conventions had to be revised: the Geneva Convention of 1929
for the Relief of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field, the Xth Hague
Convention of 1907 for the adaptation to Maritime Warfare of the Principles
of the Geneva Convention, and the 1929 Convention on the Treatment of
Prisoners of War. Furthermore, there was urgent need for a Convention for
the protection of civilians, the absence of which had, during the world conflict, led to such grievous consequences.
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS
of 12 August 1949
20 PRELIMINARY REMARKS
The International Committee worked on the lines it had followed after the
1914-1918 War. First, it collected the fullest possible preliminary information
on those aspects of International Law that required confirmation, enlargement, or amendment; then, with the help of experts from various countries,
it prepared the revised and new drafts which were submitted, first, to an
International Red Cross Conference, and then to a Diplomatic Conference
empowered to give these treaties final validity.
The first meeting of experts was held in October 1945 and comprised the neutral members of the Mixed Medical Commissions which, during the conflict,
had visited wounded or sick prisoners of war, to decide about their repatriation.
The second meeting was the “Preliminary Conference of National Red Cross
Societies for the study of the Conventions and of various problems relative to
the Red Cross”, which the International Committee convened at Geneva, in
July and August 1946, and before which the first drafts were laid.
Having gathered the suggestions of Red Cross agencies on points which were
within their particular fields, the Committee made a close study during the
months that followed, and collected very full data on all matters dealt with in
the proposed Conventions. Consultations included one, in March 1947, with
representatives of the religious and secular bodies which had collaborated with
the Committee in giving spiritual and intellectual aid to victims of the War.
From April 14 to 26, 1947, the “Conference of Government Experts for the
study of Conventions for the Protection of War Victims” was held in Geneva.
This was attended by seventy representatives of fifteen Governments which
had held large numbers of prisoners and civilian internees during the War,
and were therefore particularly experienced in the matters under discussion.
Combining the Committee’s proposals, the suggestions made by the Red
Cross Societies, and drafts prepared by several Governments, the Conference
agreed to the new texts proposed and to the first draft of a Convention for the
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.
The International Committee also sought the advice of several Governments
which were not represented at the April Conference; some sent experts to
Geneva in June 1947. The drafts in preparation were also submitted by the
Committee to a Special Commission of National Red Cross Societies, which
met at Geneva in September of the same year.
After careful editing early in the year, the Draft Conventions were sent by
the Committee, in May 1938, to all Governments and National Red Cross
Societies, in preparation for the XVIIth International Red Cross Conference.
This Conference sat in Stockholm from August 20 to 31, 1948; the representatives of fifty Governments and fifty-two National Red Cross Societies were
present. With some amendments, the drafts were adopted.
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 21
After passing through the many preparatory stages briefly described, these
texts were eventually taken as the sole Working Documents of the Diplomatic
Conference of Geneva; out of these grew the 1949 Geneva Conventions.
The Diplomatic Conference for the Establishment of International Conventions for the Protection of Victims of War, convened by the Swiss Federal
Council, as trustee of the Geneva Conventions, was held in Geneva from
April 21 to August 12, 1949
Of the sixty-three Governments represented at the Conference, fifty-nine
had sent plenipotentiaries; four sent observers only. Representatives of the
International Committee were invited to participate in the capacity of experts.
After four months of continuous debate, the Conference established the following four Conventions, which are given below:
I. Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the
Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, of August 12, 1949.
II. Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded,
Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, of August 12,
1949.
III. Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, of
August 12, 1949.
IV. Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in
Time of War, of August 12, 1949.
The Conference at once divided into four Committees; the First, for the revision of Conventions I and II; the Second, for the revision of Convention III
(Prisoners of War); the Third, to establish the new Convention relative to the
Protection of Civilian Persons; and lastly, the Joint Committee, to deal with
provisions common to the four Conventions. Co-ordination and Drafting
Committees met towards the end of the Conference, to harmonize the four
texts. When necessary, the Committees formed Working Parties.
At the closing meeting, Delegations of the following States signed the Final Act:
Afghanistan, Albania, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria,
Burma, Canada, Chile, China, Columbia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia,
Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Greece, Guatemala,
the Holy See, Hungary, India, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jugoslavia, Lebanon,
Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand,
Nicaragua, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Siam, Soviet
Socialist Republic of Bielorussia, Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine, Spain,
Sweden, Syria, Turkey, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United Kingdom,
United States of America, Uruguay, Switzerland.
22 PRELIMINARY REMARKS
Seventeen Delegations also signed the four Conventions; forty-four other
States had signed when the agreed six-months period expired on February
12, 1950. According to their provisions, the new Geneva Conventions come
into force six months after the deposit of at least two instruments of ratification. Thereafter, they come into force for each Contracting Party six months
after it ratifies.
PROVISIONS COMMON TO THE FOUR CONVENTIONS
The Geneva Diplomatic Conference made an innovation in grouping together and amplifying the common provisions, up to then dispersed and rudimentary. Now practically identical in the four Conventions, they may be
considered under three headings:
General Provisions
The General Provisions are given in a dozen Articles of great importance
at the beginning of each Convention, laying down the mode of application.
They deal with respect for the Conventions and their application in international conflict, enemy occupation or civil war. They are followed by provisions
about the duration of application, special agreements which Contracting Parties may conclude, the inalienability of the right of protected persons, the
duties of Protecting Powers or their substitutes, the activities of the International Committee of The Red Cross, and conciliation procedure between the
Contracting Parties.
Repression of Breaches of the Conventions
(Articles 49 to 52 of the First Convention, 50 to 53 of the Second, 129 to 131
of the Third, and 146 to 149 of the Fourth).
The Stockholm Conference had expressed the view that the provisions it
had approved were still inadequate, and had requested the International
Committee to continue its study of this important question. After consulting
lawyers of international repute, the Committee prepared suggestions which
appeared in the volume “Remarks and Proposals”, submitted for consideration. The Conference used these suggestions as a basis for its deliberations.
The first of the Articles imposes penal sanctions for breaches of the
Convention, in particular for “grave breaches”, as defined in the succeeding
Article.
These texts will doubtless be an important contribution towards defining
“war crimes” in International Law. The term is frequently used and seen in
print, but still awaits an acceptable legal definition.
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 23
Final Provisions
The Final Provisions appear at the end of each Convention and define the procedure for the signature, ratification and entry into force of the Conventions,
and for accession to them.
FIRST GENEVA CONVENTION
(WOUNDED AND SICK )
The traditional “Geneva Convention”, brought into being by the newly created
International Committee of the Red Cross in 1864, is the source of the “Geneva
Conventions” which are now universally accepted. The original Convention
gave the impetus to the Red Cross movement throughout the world; it likewise
inspired the impulsion in International Law towards an increasing regulationand, eventually, the restriction and final prohibition – of war itself. This first
international treaty, the fundamental principles of which have remained unshaken, was nevertheless marked by omissions and imperfections, and as early
as four years after signature, a Conference was convened to discuss its revision.
On October 20, 1868, the Conference proposed a number of additional Articles, providing in particular for the extension of the Convention to maritime
warfare, but they were never ratified. A recommendation by the First Hague
Conference in 1899 raised the question of revision again. The 1906 Diplomatic
Conference established a revised text which recast and considerably developed
the 1864 text.
After the First World War, it was clear that the Geneva Conventions needed
adapting to the conditions of modern warfare. During the 1929 Diplomatic
Conference at Geneva, the text was once more revised, although to a lesser
extent than on the first occasion.
In 1937, after renewed discussion by a Commission of international Experts
called by the International Committee, another revised text was established.
The draft, after submission to the XVIth International Red Cross Conference
(London, I938), was placed on the agenda of the Diplomatic Conference
planned for 1940 but postponed by the Second World War.
We have shown how the 1937 draft was shaped by the experience of the six
momentous war years. The help of the National Red Cross Societies, closely
involved historically in the application and development of the Convention,
was particularly valuable.
The text of the First Convention, as revised by the 1949 Conference, follows
traditional lines and the fundamental principles that governed former versions:
wounded or sick – and therefore defenceless – combatants shall be respected
24 PRELIMINARY REMARKS
and cared for, whatever their nationality; personnel attending them, the buildings in which they shelter and the equipment used for their benefit, shall be
protected; a red cross on a white ground shall be the emblem of this immunity. As will be seen later, the greatest divergence arises from the very conditions of modern warfare, which made it necessary to restrict the privileges
of medical personnel and equipment in enemy hands. On the other hand,
almost all Articles have been made more precise.
The General Provisions are followed by Chapter II, dealing with the wounded
and sick. Article 13, drawn from the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention, enumerates the categories of persons put on the same footing as members of
the armed forces, and hence entitled to protection under the Convention.
Whereas the 1949 text demanded respect and protection only for the wounded, Article 12, which is new, gives a list of prohibited acts: attempts upon life,
torture, wilful abandonment and so on. The information to be given about
wounded captives, and the duties to the dead have been defined (Art. 16 and
17). A new provision (Art. 18) guarantees to the inhabitants and to Relief
Societies the right of assisting the wounded and sick.
Chapter III (Medical Units and Establishments) has not undergone alteration, except for the introduction of Article 23 (Creation of Safety Zones and
Localities).
Chapter IV (Medical Personnel and Chaplains) has been greatly modified.
Hitherto, such personnel falling into enemy hands had to be immediately
repatriated.
The 1949 Convention provides that they may, in certain circumstances, be
retained to care for prisoners of war. Their special status and the conditions
for the repatriation of those not required (Art. 30 to 32) have been carefully
defined (Art. 28), thus filling a serious gap.
Chapter V (Medical Equipment) has been substantially altered, to take
changes regarding personnel into account.
Equipment need no longer be handed back to the belligerent to whom it
belongs.
In Chapter VI similar provision is made for transport vehicles (Art. 35). It
should be noted that medical aircraft are now authorized, in certain circumstances, to fly over neutral countries (Art. 37).
Chapter VII (Distinctive Emblem) marks no change in principle. Nevertheless
Article 44, the wording of which left so much to be desired in the 1929 text,
is now stated in logical and balanced terms. While the “protective” emblem
is subject to strict safeguards, the purely “indicatory” emblem may be widely
used by Red Cross Societies.
Chapter VIII (Application of the Convention) calls for no comment.
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 25
Reference has already been made to Chapter IX (Repression of Abuses and
Infractions), and to the Final Provisions. Article 53, which is peculiar to the
First Convention, is intended to prevent abuse of the distinctive emblem.
SECOND GENEVA CONVENTION
(Maritime)
The 1868 Diplomatic Conference, at Geneva, formulated the first provisions
for the adaptation to maritime warfare of the principles of the Geneva Convention. This draft was not ratified, but later became The Hague Convention
of 1899, and afterwards the Xth Hague Convention of 1907, which was ratified by forty-seven States and still remains in force.
Nevertheless, evolution in the methods of warfare and the fact that the First
Geneva Convention was revised in 1929, made a recasting of the Xth Hague
Convention essential. After preliminary study, the International Committee,
with the help of a Conference of Naval Experts, drafted in 1937 a Revised
Convention, which was placed on the agenda of the Diplomatic Conference
scheduled for 1940.
This draft, extended after 1945 in the light of war experience, was used as a
basis by the Diplomatic Conference in 1949.
The Maritime Convention, as it is called, is an extension of the First Convention (Wounded and Sick), the terms of which it applies to maritime warfare; it
is therefore natural that it should be included among the Geneva Conventions,
out of which it originally developed.
As the general plan of this Second Geneva Convention covers the same field
and protects the same categories of persons as the First, no comment is necessary on its basic principles. It contains, however, no less than sixty-three
Articles, whereas the 1907 version had only twenty-eight. This is because
the 1949 text (similar to the 1937 draft) adapts the provision of the Land
Convention and closely follows them. It has thus become a complete and independent Convention, whereas the 1907 Hague text was chiefly concerned
to adapt humanitarian provisions to naval warfare.
Following the General Provisions common to the four Conventions,
Chapter II protects the shipwrecked in addition to the wounded and sick.
Members of the Merchant Navy are protected under the terms of Article 13,
insofar as they are not entitled to more favourable treatment under other provisions in International Law. The qualification, new in treaty law, is in conformity with ordinary practice.
26 PRELIMINARY REMARKS
Chapter III, obviously applicable only to maritime warfare deals with Hospital
Ships and other relief craft.
Chapter IV. At sea, medical personnel, on account of prevailing conditions,
are given wider protection than on land. In particular, the medical personnel
and crew, vital to the hospital ships as such, may not be captured or retained.
The personnel of other ships, while they may in some cases be retained,
must be put ashore as soon as possible and will then come under the First
Convention.
Chapter V (Medical Transports) has its parallel in the First Convention, but
the Maritime Convention makes no special provision for the equipment,
which is, in a sense, part and parcel of the vessel itself.
There were no fighting aircraft in 1907. Hence the addition, in Chapter VI
(Distinctive Emblem), of provisions for the more efficient marking of hospital
ships, as a safeguard against air attack.
Chapters VII (Execution of the Convention) and VIII (Repression of Abuses
and Infractions), as well as the Final Provisions, call for no special comment.
THIRD GENEVA CONVENTION
(PRISONERS OF WAR)
The Third Convention contains one hundred and forty-three Articles, besides the Annexes. The corresponding 1929 Convention had ninety-seven
Articles, and the Chapter on prisoners of war in the Hague Convention, only
seventeen. This extension is no doubt due, in part, to the fact that, in modern
warfare, prisoners are held in very large numbers, but it also interprets the
desire of the 1949 Conference, representing all nations, to submit all aspects
of captivity to humane regulation by International Law.
The aspiration is not new. The nineteenth century saw new concepts of
natural law and a new humanitarian movement – in particular the ideas of
Henry Dunant, who applied himself to the prisoner of war problem after the
wounded and sick had been provided for. The civilized world finally accepted
the principle that the prisoner of war is not a criminal, but merely an enemy
no longer able to bear arms, who should be liberated at the close of hostilities, and be respected and humanely treated while in captivity. Far-seeing and
broad-minded legal and diplomatic action has since translated concept into
practice, through a series of codifications accepted as binding by States, and
successively extended or amplified when experience showed them to be inadequate. The Brussels Draft of 1874, the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907,
the special agreements made between belligerents in Berne in 1917 and 1918,
and the Geneva Conventions of 1929, which devote all or part of their clauses
to prisoners of war, represent the principal stages of this evolution.
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 27
Wherever it was applied, the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention effectively
helped to protect the millions of men who relied upon it during the last conflict. Nevertheless, it was quite evident, both to those who benefited and to
those by whom it was applied, that the Convention required revision on many
points; there have been changes in the methods and the consequences of war,
and even in the living conditions of peoples. It was necessary to broaden the
categories of persons entitled to prisoner of war status, so that such status
is in fact granted to members of forces which capitulate, and that prisoners may not be arbitrarily deprived of it, at any time. A more precise definition of the conditions of captivity was also required which would take into
account the importance assumed by prisoner of war labour, the relief they
receive, and the judicial proceedings instituted against them. The principle
of the immediate liberation of prisoners on the close of hostilities had to be
reaffirmed. Finally, it was essential that the agencies appointed to look after
prisoners’ interests and ensure that regulations concerning them are applied
in full, should be as independent as possible of the political relations existing
between the belligerents. These were the most urgent only of the problems
that the War revealed.
Thus, before hostilities had ceased, and concurrently with the even more urgent task of preparing a Civilian Convention, the International Committee
began to work upon the revision of the 1929 Prisoners of War Convention.
As already pointed out, the 1939 Convention is far longer than the agreement
it replaces. But, whilst many of its provisions represent a logical development
of the 1929 Convention, experience has shown that the daily lives of prisoners
may depend on the interpretation given to a general rule. An attempt has
therefore been made to give certain regulations an explicit form, precluding
the misinterpretation to which they were formerly open. Moreover, principles which it was felt would have greater force for being tersely worded-e.g.
Article 2 of the 1929 text had been so seriously violated that the Conference
has recast them in terms comprehensive and clear enough to make any future
infringement immediately apparent.
Another group of provisions is designed to provide a satisfactory solution for
the numerous problems outlined above. This task was more difficult. In many
instances, the Conference had to devise entirely new regulations as in the
Section dealing with the financial resources of prisoners of war-or deliberately to break with certain rules which, in 1929, had been transferred more or
less bodily from the Hague Regulations. One instance is the rule concerning
the liberation of prisoners at the close of hostilities.
Some of the details may seem superfluous; repetition and lack of harmony
between certain provisions may also cause surprise. It should, however, be
28 PRELIMINARY REMARKS
remembered that, whilst throughout concerned with the Convention as an
instrument in International Law, the Conference had constantly in mind a
special use to which it was to be put-regulations to be posted in prisoner of
war camps and comprehensible not only to the authorities, but to the ordinary
reader. Furthermore, the Conference did not hesitate to sacrifice neatness in
the interests of unanimous agreement. These are reasons, which with the difficulty of establishing official legal texts simultaneously in two languages, may
account for, and even justify, most of the textual imperfections to be found in
the Prisoners of War Convention.
The Table which appears at the end of the volume and the marginal notes to
each Article make it easy to grasp the general plan, which is, as far as possible, similar to that of the 1929 Convention. The general outline is as follows:
amongst the general Provisions (Art. I to II), which have already been dealt
with, Article 4, defining the categories of persons entitled to prisoner of war
treatment, is a vital element of the Convention.
Part II (General Protection of Prisoners of War, Art. 12 to 16) contains the
essential principles which shall, at all times and in all places, govern the treatment of prisoners.
Part. III (Art. 17 to 108) deals with the conditions of captivity and is divided
into six Sections. The first, (Art.17 to 20) covers events immediately after capture and deals with such matters as interrogation of prisoners, disposal of their
personal effects, and their evacuation. The second, comprising eight Chapters
(Art. 21 to 48), regulates living conditions for prisoners in camp or during
transfer, and deals with the places and methods of internment, accommodation, food and clothing, hygiene and medical attention, medical and religious
personnel retained for the care of prisoners (a new Chapter, which partly reproduces the provisions of the First Convention), religious needs, intellectual and
physical activities, discipline, prisoner of war ranks, and transfer after arrival
in a camp. Prisoners’ labour is dealt with in the third Section (Art. 49 to 57);
the fourth Section (Art. 58 to 68) is new and concerns the financial resources
of prisoners. The fifth Section (Art. 69 to 77) covers everything concerned with
correspondence and relief shipments. The sixth and last Section (Art. 78 to
108) which is in three Chapters, covers the relations between prisoners of war
and the detaining authorities, complaints regarding captivity, prisoners’ representatives, and penal and disciplinary sanctions. This last Chapter (Art. 82 to
108) constitutes in itself a brief code of penal and disciplinary procedure.
The various measures for the termination of captivity are contained in Part IV
(Art. 109 to 121), which is divided into three Sections. The first (Art. 109 to
117) refers to repatriation and accommodation of prisoners in neutral countries during hostilities, the second (Art. 118 and 119) to repatriation at the
close of hostilities, and the third (Art. 120 and 121) to the death of prisoners
of war.
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 29
Part. V (Art. 122 to 125) contains provisions about Prisoners of War
Information Bureaux and all organizations formed to assist prisoners.
Part. VI (Execution of the Convention, Art. 126 to 143) contains, in the first
Section (Art. 126 to 132), a variety of most important stipulations requiring belligerents, inter alia, to give neutral organizations free access to prisoner of war camps for inspection purposes, and to disseminate the text of
the Convention as widely as possible. Articles 129 to 131 further contain the
provisions common to the four Conventions for the repression of breaches.
Five Annexes are closely connected with the Convention. Annex I (Model
Agreement concerning Direct Repatriation and Accommodation in Neutral
Countries of Wounded and Sick Prisoners of War), Annex III (Regulations
concerning Collective Relief), and Annex V (Model Regulations concerning
Payments sent by Prisoners to their own country) are intended to substitute in
the absence of specific agreement on these questions between the belligerents
concerned. Annex II (Regulations concerning Mixed Medical Commissions)
is prescriptive. Annex IV proposes standard model documents, such as identity or capture cards, correspondence cards, death notifications etc.
FOURTH GENEVA CONVENTION
(CIVILIANS )
The Fourth Convention forms an important contribution to written International Law in the humanitarian domain.
Strictly speaking, this Convention introduces nothing new in a field where
the doctrine is sufficiently well established. It adds no specifically new ideas to
International Law on the subject, but aims at ensuring that, even in the midst
of hostilities, the dignity of the human person, universally acknowledged in
principle, shall be respected.
The original humanitarian legislation represented by the First Geneva
Convention of 1864 provided only for combatants, as at that time it was considered evident that civilians would remain outside hostilities.
The Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, annexed
to the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907, made no provision for civilians
(apart from spies), except where there was occupation of territory by enemy
armed forces. They merely set forth a small number of elementary rules, in
pursuance of the principle that the occupant shall “take all the measures in his
power to restore, and as far as possible ensure public order and safety while
respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country”
(Art. 43). Thus: “Family honour and rights, the lives of persons and private
property, as well as religious convictions and practice, must be respected”
(Art. 46); “Pillage is formally forbidden” (Art. 47); “No general penalty,
30 PRELIMINARY REMARKS
pecuniary or otherwise, shall be inflicted upon the population on account
of the acts of individuals for which they cannot be regarded as jointly and
severally responsible” (Art. 50). Such were the main and essential provisions,
tersely expressed, governing the occupation of territory.
The development of arms and the increased radius of action given to armed
forces by modern inventions have made it apparent that, notwithstanding the
ruling theory, civilians were certainly “in the war”, and exposed to the same
dangers as the combatants – and sometimes worse.
The Xth International Red Cross Conference (1921) – the first after the World
War – set forth certain general principles, on the proposal of the International
Committee, in regard to deported, evacuated or refugee civilians, these prohibited deportation en masse, or without preliminary trial, and the taking
of hostages; they enjoined liberty of movement, and the right to correspond
and to receive relief. In 1923, the XIth International Conference called for
a Convention to supplement the Hague Regulations. The XIIth Conference
devised regulations for the protection of civilians on the territory of an enemy State; these recognised the right to leave the territory, unless the safety of
the State was involved, and provided for speedier enquiries, Mixed Medical
Commissions for the examination of men unfit for service, transmission to
the International Committee of lists of retained civilians, the grant to civilians
of the same privileges as to prisoners of war, inspection of places of internment, and agreements between belligerents for the benefit of civilians.
The 1929 Diplomatic Conference, which revised the First Convention and
drew up the Convention for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, unanimously
recommended that “careful study should be made with a view to the conclusion of an international Convention on the conditions and protection of
civilians of enemy nationality in the territory of a belligerent, or in belligerent-occupied territory”.
The International Committee wholeheartedly entered into the task thus defined, setting up a Legal Commission which prepared a draft Convention in
forty Articles. This draft, generally known as the “Tokyo Draft”, was approved
by the XVth International Red Cross Conference (Tokyo, 1934). It was intended for submission to the Diplomatic Conference planned for 1940, but
postponed on account of the War. The International Committee was, at best,
able to obtain an undertaking from the belligerent States that the essential
provisions of the Prisoners of War Convention would be extended to interned
civilians who were in enemy territory at the outbreak of hostilities-as was in
fact prescribed in the Tokyo Draft.
The events which followed were to show the disastrous consequences of the
failure to provide – in addition to the few principles embodied in the Hague
Regulations – an international Convention for the protection of civilians in
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 31
wartime, particularly of those in occupied territories; this tragic period was one
of deportations, mass extermination, taking and killing of hostages, and pillage.
Immediately hostilities ceased, therefore, the International Committee, in
keeping with its humanitarian duty, informed all Governments and Red
Cross Societies of its intention to resume its efforts to set up an international
Convention for the protection of civilians. This statement met with universal
approval.
The Geneva Diplomatic Conference was not called to revise the Fourth Hague Convention. The Civilian Convention of August 12, 1949, therefore in
no way invalidates the Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War
on Land; it is not a substitute for that agreement, which remains in force. As
happily expressed by the Conference, the Convention “shall be supplementary to Sections II and III” of the said Regulations. (See Fourth Convention,
Art. 154.)
The new Convention contains one hundred and fifty-nine Articles and two
Annexes. According to the text of a draft Preamble submitted by the French
and Finnish Delegations – but not adopted, as the Conference decided to
follow the precedent of the other Geneva Conventions, which contain no
Preamble – it is inspired by “the eternal principles of that Law which is the
foundation and the safeguard of civilization “, and is designed to “ ensure the
respect of human personality and dignity by putting beyond reach of attack
those rights and liberties which are the essence of its existence”.
It prohibits in particular:
a) Violence to life and person, in particular torture, mutilations or cruel
treatment.
b) The taking of hostages.
c) Deportations.
d) Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating or degrading treatment, or adverse treatment founded on differences of race,
colour, nationality, religion, beliefs, sex, birth or social status.
e) The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court

civilized peoples.
In the present edition, a Table is appended showing the division into Parts,
Sections and Chapters, and reproducing the marginal notes to each Article.
Reference to this Table will afford a complete outline of the subjects dealt
with, and the position they occupy in the Convention.
32 PRELIMINARY REMARKS
Amongst the General Provisions, Article 4 gives the following definition of
the persons who will have the benefit of the Convention:
“Persons protected by the Convention are those who, at a given moment and
in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they
are not nationals.
“Nationals of a State which is not bound by the Convention are not protected
by it.
“Nationals of a neutral State who find themselves in the territory of a belligerent State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, shall not be regarded
as protected persons while the State of which they are nationals has normal
diplomatic representation in the State in whose hands they are.”
The last two clauses were added by the Conference to the draft, which was
found too narrow on this particular point.
Part II (Art. 13 to 26) concerns the general protection of populations against
certain consequences of war. It goes beyond the limits set up by Article 4, and
covers the population as a whole, i.e. not only “protected persons”, but also
those who cannot avail themselves of this protection and, in particular, those
who are nationals of the Party to the conflict, or of the Occupying Power by
whom they are held.
There is thus provision for hospital and safety zones and localities, and
neutralized zones (Art. 14 and 15), for the protection of civilian hospitals
(Art. 18), for measures in behalf of children (Art. 24) and for the exchange
of family news (Art. 25). In all cases these measures are quite general in
scope, giving neither the grounds, nor indeed any practical opportunity, for
discrimination.
Part III (Art. 27 to 141) defines the status and treatment of protected persons,
and the manner of the application of the Convention.
Following the precedent of the Tokyo Draft, it distinguishes between foreign
nationals on the territory of a Party to the conflict, and the population of occupied territories.
It is divided into five Sections.
Section I contains provisions common to the above two categories of persons,
dealing with the responsibilities of the State and of its agents (Art. 29), application to Protecting Powers and relief organizations (Art. 30), prohibition of
corporal punishments (Art. 32), of collective penalties, terrorism, pillage and
reprisals (Art. 33), and of the taking of hostages (Art. 34).
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 33
Section II relates to aliens in the territory of a Party to the conflict, and deals
with the right to leave the territory (Art. 35), protection in case of internment
(Art. 41), and refugees (Art. 44).
Section III contains the prescriptions for occupied territories, on such subjects as inviolability of rights (Art. 47), deportations, transfers and evacuations (Art. 49), children (Art. 50), labour (Art. 51) food (Art. 55), hygiene
and public health (Art. 56), spiritual assistance (Art. 58), relief (Art. 59 to 63),
penal legislation (Art. 64 to 75), and treatment of detainees (Art. 76).
Section IV deals with internment. It is divided into twelve Chapters, the contents of which are in general analogous to the provisions adopted for prisoners of war. (Chapter I-General Provisions; Chapter II-Places of internment;
Chapter III-Food and clothing ; Chapter IV-Hygiene and medical attention;
Chapter V-Religious, intellectual and physical activities; Chapter VI-Personal
property and financial resources; Chapter VII-Administration and discipline;
Chapter VIII-Relations with the exterior; Chapter IX-Penal and disciplinary
sanctions; Chapter X-Transfers of internees; Chapter XI-Deaths; Chapter
XII-Release, repatriation and accommodation in neutral countries).
Section V is devoted to Information Bureaux and the Central Agency, the
functioning of which is to follow that of the Central Prisoners of War Agency.
Part IV (Art. 142 to 159) concerns the execution of the Convention. Section I
(General Provisions) contains, amongst others, the provision on the repression of breaches of the Convention, already mentioned.
Finally, the 1949 Diplomatic Conference passed eleven Resolutions which refer to the Geneva Conventions, but do not form part of them; they will also
be found in the present edition.

The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of
the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets

their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention
in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions
thereof.

In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in
the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict
shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions:

present Convention.
The application of the preceding provisions shall not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict.
Article 4

agreements for all matters concerning which they may deem it suitable to
make separate provision. No special agreement shall adversely affect the situation of the wounded and sick, of members of the medical personnel or of
chaplains, as defined by the present Convention, nor restrict the rights which
it confers upon them.

THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 37
Wounded and sick, as well as medical personnel and chaplains, shall continue
to have the benefit of such agreements as long as the Convention is applicable
to them, except where express provisions to the contrary are contained in the
aforesaid or in subsequent agreements, or where more favourable measures have
been taken with regard to them by one or other of the Parties to the conflict.
Article 7
Wounded and sick, as well as members of the medical personnel and chaplains, may in no circumstances renounce in part or in entirety the rights
secured to them by the present Convention, and by the special agreements
referred to in the foregoing Article, if such there be.
Article 8
The present Convention shall be applied with the co-operation and under the
scrutiny of the Protecting Powers whose duty it is to safeguard the interests of
the Parties to the conflict. For this purpose, the Protecting Powers may appoint,
apart from their diplomatic or consular staff, delegates from amongst their own
nationals or the nationals of other neutral Powers. The said delegates shall be
subject to the approval of the Power with which they are to carry out their duties.
The Parties to the conflict shall facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the
task of the representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers.
The representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers shall not in any case
exceed their mission under the present Convention. They shall, in particular,
take account of the imperative necessities of security of the State wherein they
carry out their duties. Their activities shall only be restricted, as an exceptional and temporary measure, when this is rendered necessary by imperative
military necessities.
Article 9
The provisions of the present Convention constitute no obstacle to the humanitarian activities which the International Committee of the Red Cross or
any other impartial humanitarian organization may, subject to the consent of
the Parties to the conflict concerned, undertake for the protection of wounded and sick, medical personnel and chaplains, and for their relief.
Article 10
The High Contracting Parties may at any time agree to entrust to an organization which offers all guarantees of impartiality and efficacy the duties incumbent on the Protecting Powers by virtue of the present Convention.

Power or of an organization provided for in the first paragraph above, the
Detaining Power shall request a neutral State, or such an organization,
to undertake the functions performed under the present Convention by a
Protecting Power designated by the Parties to a conflict.
If protection cannot be arranged accordingly, the Detaining Power shall request or shall accept, subject to the provisions of this Article, the offer of the
services of a humanitarian organization, such as the International Committee
of the Red Cross, to assume the humanitarian functions performed by
Protecting Powers under the present Convention.
Any neutral Power, or any organization invited by the Power concerned or
offering itself for these purposes, shall be required to act with a sense of responsibility towards the Party to the conflict on which persons protected by
the present Convention depend, and shall be required to furnish sufficient
assurances that it is in a position to undertake the appropriate functions and
to discharge them impartially.
No derogation from the preceding provisions shall be made by special agreements between Powers one of which is restricted, even temporarily, in its
freedom to negotiate with the other Power or its allies by reason of military
events, more particularly where the whole, or a substantial part, of the territory of the said Power is occupied.
Whenever in the present Convention mention is made of a Protecting Power,
such mention also applies to substitute organizations in the sense of the present Article.
Article 11
In cases where they deem it advisable in the interest of protected persons,
particularly in cases of disagreement between the Parties to the conflict as to
the application or interpretation of the provisions of the present Convention,
the Protecting Powers shall lend their good offices with a view to settling the
disagreement.
For this purpose, each of the Protecting Powers may, either at the invitation
of one Party or on its own initiative, propose to the Parties to the conflict a
meeting of their representatives, in particular of the authorities responsible
for the wounded and sick, members of medical personnel and chaplains, possibly on neutral territory suitably chosen. The Parties to the conflict shall be
bound to give effect to the proposals made to them for this purpose. The
Protecting Powers may, if necessary, propose for approval by the Parties
to the conflict a person belonging to a neutral Power or delegated by the
International Committee of the Red Cross, who shall be invited to take part
in such a meeting.

CHAPTER II
Wounded and Sick
Article 12
Members of the armed forces and other persons mentioned in the following Article, who are wounded or sick, shall be respected and protected in all
circumstances.
They shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Party to the conflict in
whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex,
race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any
attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected
to torture or to biological experiments; they shall not wilfully be left without
medical assistance and care, nor shall conditions exposing them to contagion
or infection be created.
Only urgent medical reasons will authorize priority in the order of treatment
to be administered.
Women shall be treated with all consideration due to their sex.
The Party to the conflict which is compelled to abandon wounded or sick to
the enemy shall, as far as military considerations permit, leave with them a
part of its medical personnel and material to assist in their care.
Article 13
The Present Convention shall apply to the wounded and sick belonging to the
following categories:
1) Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.
2) Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party
to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this
territory is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfil the following conditions:
a) that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;
b) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;
c) that of carrying arms openly;
d) that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and
customs of war.
3) Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a Government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power.

40 FIRST CONVENTION
4) Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of military aircraft crews, war correspondents, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services
responsible for the welfare of the armed forces, provided that they have
received authorization from the armed forces which they accompany.
5) Members of crews including masters, pilots and apprentices of the merchant marine and the crews of civil aircraft of the Parties to the conflict,
who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under any other provisions in international law.
6) Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory who, on the approach of the enemy, spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without
having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided
they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war.
Article 14
Subject to the provisions of Article 12, the wounded and sick of a belligerent
who fall into enemy hands shall be prisoners of war, and the provisions of
international law concerning prisoners of war shall apply to them.
Article 15
At all times, and particularly after an engagement, Parties to the conflict shall,
without delay, take all possible measures to search for and collect the wounded and sick, to protect them against pillage and ill-treatment, to ensure their
adequate care, and to search for the dead and prevent their being despoiled.
Whenever circumstances permit, an armistice or a suspension of fire shall be
arranged, or local arrangements made, to permit the removal, exchange and
transport of the wounded left on the battlefield.
Likewise, local arrangements may be concluded between Parties to the conflict for the removal or exchange of wounded and sick from a besieged or
encircled area, and for the passage of medical and religious personnel and
equipment on their way to that area.
Article 16
Parties to the conflict shall record as soon as possible, in respect of each
wounded, sick or dead person of the adverse Party falling into their hands,
any particulars which may assist in his identification.
These records should if possible include:
a) designation of the Power on which he depends;
b) army, regimental, personal or serial number;
c) surname;
d) first name or names;
Search for
casualties.

f) any other particulars shown on his identity card or disc;
g) date and place of capture or death;
h) particulars concerning wounds or illness, or cause of death.
As soon as possible the above mentioned information shall be forwarded to
the Information Bureau described in Article 122 of the Geneva Convention
relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949, which
shall transmit this information to the Power on which these persons depend through the intermediary of the Protecting Power and of the Central
Prisoners of War Agency.
Parties to the conflict shall prepare and forward to each other through the
same bureau, certificates of death or duly authenticated lists of the dead.
They shall likewise collect and forward through the same bureau one half
of a double identity disc, last wills or other documents of importance to the
next of kin, money and in general all articles of an intrinsic or sentimental
value, which are found on the dead. These articles, together with unidentified
articles, shall be sent in sealed packets, accompanied by statements giving all
particulars necessary for the identification of the deceased owners, as well as
by a complete list of the contents of the parcel.
Article 17
Parties to the conflict shall ensure that burial or cremation of the dead, carried out individually as far as circumstances permit, is preceded by a careful
examination, if possible by a medical examination, of the bodies, with a view
to confirming death, establishing identity and enabling a report to be made.
One half of the double identity disc, or the identity disc itself if it is a single
disc, should remain on the body.
Bodies shall not be cremated except for imperative reasons of hygiene or for
motives based on the religion of the deceased. In case of cremation, the circumstances and reasons for cremation shall be stated in detail in the death
certificate or on the authenticated list of the dead.
They shall further ensure that the dead are honourably interred, if possible
according to the rites of the religion to which they belonged, that their graves
are respected, grouped if possible according to the nationality of the deceased,
properly maintained and marked so that they may always be found. For this
purpose, they shall organize at the commencement of hostilities an Official
Graves Registration Service, to allow subsequent exhumations and to ensure
the identification of bodies, whatever the site of the graves, and the possible
transportation to the home country. These provisions shall likewise apply to
the ashes, which shall be kept by the Graves Registration Service until proper
disposal thereof in accordance with the wishes of the home country.

As soon as circumstances permit, and at latest at the end of hostilities, these
Services shall exchange, through the Information Bureau mentioned in the
second paragraph of Article 16, lists showing the exact location and markings
of the graves together with particulars of the dead interred therein.
Article 18
The military authorities may appeal to the charity of the inhabitants voluntarily to collect and care for, under their direction, the wounded and sick,
granting persons who have responded to this appeal the necessary protection
and facilities. Should the adverse Party take or retake control of the area, it
shall likewise grant these persons the same protection and the same facilities.
The military authorities shall permit the inhabitants and relief societies, even
in invaded or occupied areas, spontaneously to collect and care for wounded
or sick of whatever nationality. The civilian population shall respect these
wounded and sick, and in particular abstain from offering them violence.
No one may ever be molested or convicted for having nursed the wounded
or sick.
The provisions of the present Article do not relieve the occupying Power of
its obligation to give both physical and moral care to the wounded and sick.
CHAPTER III
Medical Units and Establishments
Article 19
Fixed establishments and mobile medical units of the Medical Service may in
no circumstances be attacked, but shall at all times be respected and protected
by the Parties to the conflict. Should they fall into the hands of the adverse
Party, their personnel shall be free to pursue their duties, as long as the capturing Power has not itself ensured the necessary care of the wounded and
sick found in such establishments and units.
The responsible authorities shall ensure that the said medical establishments
and units are, as far as possible, situated in such a manner that attacks against
military objectives cannot imperil their safety.
Article 20
Hospital ships entitled to the protection of the Geneva Convention for the
Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members
of Armed Forces at Sea of August 12, 1949, shall not be attacked from the land.

Article 21
The protection to which fixed establishments and mobile medical units of the
Medical Service are entitled shall not cease unless they are used to commit, outside their humanitarian duties, acts harmful to the enemy. Protection may, however, cease only after a due warning has been given, naming, in all appropriate
cases, a reasonable time limit and after such warning has remained unheeded.
Article 22
The following conditions shall not be considered as depriving a medical unit
or establishment of the protection guaranteed by Article 19:
1. That the personnel of the unit or establishment are armed, and that they
use the arms in their own defence, or in that of the wounded and sick in
their charge.
2. That in the absence of armed orderlies, the unit or establishment is protected by a picket or by sentries or by an escort.
3. That small arms and ammunition taken from the wounded and sick
and not yet handed to the proper service, are found in the unit or establishment.
4. That personnel and material of the veterinary service are found in the
unit or establishment, without forming an integral part thereof.
5. That the humanitarian activities of medical units and establishments or
of their personnel extend to the care of civilian wounded or sick.
Article 23
In time of peace, the High Contracting Parties and, after the outbreak of hostilities, the Parties to the conflict, may establish in their own territory and, if
the need arises, in occupied areas, hospital zones and localities so organized
as to protect the wounded and sick from the effects of war, as well as the personnel entrusted with the organization and administration of these zones and
localities and with the care of the persons therein assembled.
Upon the outbreak and during the course of hostilities, the Parties concerned
may conclude agreements on mutual recognition of the hospital zones and
localities they have created. They may for this purpose implement the provisions of the Draft Agreement annexed to the present Convention, with such
amendments as they may consider necessary.
The Protecting Powers and the International Committee of the Red Cross
are invited to lend their good offices in order to facilitate the institution and
recognition of these hospital zones and localities.

Personnel
Article 24
Medical personnel exclusively engaged in the search for, or the collection,
transport or treatment of the wounded or sick, or in the prevention of disease,
staff exclusively engaged in the administration of medical units and establishments, as well as chaplains attached to the armed forces, shall be respected
and protected in all circumstances.
Article 25
Members of the armed forces specially trained for employment, should the
need arise, as hospital orderlies, nurses or auxiliary stretcher-bearers, in the
search for or the collection, transport or treatment of the wounded and sick
shall likewise be respected and protected if they are carrying out these duties
at the time when they come into contact with the enemy or fall into his hands.
Article 26
The staff of National Red Cross Societies and that of other Voluntary Aid
Societies, duly recognized and authorized by their Governments, who may be
employed on the same duties as the personnel named in Article 24, are placed
on the same footing as the personnel named in the said Article, provided that
the staff of such societies are subject to military laws and regulations.
Each High Contracting Party shall notify to the other, either in time of peace
or at the commencement of or during hostilities, but in any case before actually employing them, the names of the societies which it has authorized,
under its responsibility, to render assistance to the regular medical service of
its armed forces.
Article 27
A recognized Society of a neutral country can only lend the assistance of its
medical personnel and units to a Party to the conflict with the previous consent of its own Government and the authorization of the Party to the conflict
concerned. That personnel and those units shall be placed under the control
of that Party to the conflict.
The neutral Government shall notify this consent to the adversary of the State
which accepts such assistance. The Party to the conflict who accepts such assistance is bound to notify the adverse Party thereof before making any use of it.
In no circumstances shall this assistance be considered as interference in the
conflict.

The members of the personnel named in the first paragraph shall be duly
furnished with the identity cards provided for in Article 40 before leaving the
neutral country to which they belong.
Article 28
Personnel designated in Articles 24 and 26 who fall into the hands of the adverse Party, shall be retained only in so far as the state of health, the spiritual
needs and the number of prisoners of war require.
Personnel thus retained shall not be deemed prisoners of war. Nevertheless
they shall at least benefit by all the provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949. Within the
framework of the military laws and regulations of the Detaining Power, and
under the authority of its competent service, they shall continue to carry out,
in accordance with their professional ethics, their medical and spiritual duties
on behalf of prisoners of war, preferably those of the armed forces to which
they themselves belong. They shall further enjoy the following facilities for
carrying out their medical or spiritual duties:
a) They shall be authorized to visit periodically the prisoners of war
in labour units or hospitals outside the camp. The Detaining Power
shall put at their disposal the means of transport required.
b) In each camp the senior medical officer of the highest rank shall be
responsible to the military authorities of the camp for the professional activity of the retained medical personnel. For this purpose,
from the outbreak of hostilities, the Parties to the conflict shall agree
regarding the corresponding seniority of the ranks of their medical
personnel, including those of the societies designated in Article 26.
In all questions arising out of their duties, this medical officer, and
the chaplains, shall have direct access to the military and medical
authorities of the camp who shall grant them the facilities they may
require for correspondence relating to these questions.
c) Although retained personnel in a camp shall be subject to its internal
discipline, they shall not, however, be required to perform any work
outside their medical or religious duties.
During hostilities the Parties to the conflict shall make arrangements for relieving where possible retained personnel, and shall settle the procedure of
such relief.
None of the preceding provisions shall relieve the Detaining Power of the
obligations imposed upon it with regard to the medical and spiritual welfare
of the prisoners of war.
Retained
personnel
46 FIRST CONVENTION
Article 29
Members of the personnel designated in Article 25 who have fallen into the
hands of the enemy, shall be prisoners of war, but shall be employed on their
medical duties in so far as the need arises.
Article 30
Personnel whose retention is not indispensable by virtue of the provisions of
Article 28 shall be returned to the Party to the conflict to whom they belong,
as soon as a road is open for their return and military requirements permit.
Pending their return, they shall not be deemed prisoners of war. Nevertheless
they shall at least benefit by all the provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949. They shall continue to fulfil their duties under the orders of the adverse Party and shall
preferably be engaged in the care of the wounded and sick of the Party to the
conflict to which they themselves belong.
On their departure, they shall take with them the effects, personal belongings,
valuables and instruments belonging to them.
Article 31
The selection of personnel for return under Article 30 shall be made irrespective of any consideration of race, religion or political opinion, but preferably
according to the chronological order of their capture and their state of health.
As from the outbreak of hostilities, Parties to the conflict may determine by
special agreement the percentage of personnel to be retained, in proportion to
the number of prisoners and the distribution of the said personnel in the camps.
Article 32
Persons designated in Article 27 who have fallen into the hands of the adverse
Party may not be detained.
Unless otherwise agreed, they shall have permission to return to their country, or if this is not possible, to the territory of the Party to the conflict in
whose service they were, as soon as a route for their return is open and military considerations permit.
Pending their release, they shall continue their work under the direction of
the adverse Party; they shall preferably be engaged in the care of the wounded
and sick of the Party to the conflict in whose service they were.
On their departure, they shall take with them their effects, personal articles
and valuables and the instruments, arms and if possible the means of transport belonging to them.

The material of mobile medical units of the armed forces which fall into the
hands of the enemy, shall be reserved for the care of wounded and sick.
The buildings, material and stores of fixed medical establishments of the
armed forces shall remain subject to the laws of war, but may not be diverted
from that purpose as long as they are required for the care of wounded and
sick. Nevertheless, the commanders of forces in the field may make use of
them, in case of urgent military necessity, provided that they make previous
arrangements for the welfare of the wounded and sick who are nursed in them.
The material and stores defined in the present Article shall not be intentionally destroyed.
Article 34
The real and personal property of aid societies which are admitted to the privileges of the Convention shall be regarded as private property.

CHAPTER VI
Medical Transports
Article 35
Transports of wounded and sick or of medical equipment shall be respected
and protected in the same way as mobile medical units.

conflict who captures them shall in all cases ensure the care of the wounded
and sick they contain.
The civilian personnel and all means of transport obtained by requisition
shall be subject to the general rules of international law.

48 FIRST CONVENTION
Article 36
Medical aircraft, that is to say, aircraft exclusively employed for the removal
of wounded and sick and for the transport of medical personnel and equipment, shall not be attacked, but shall be respected by the belligerents, while
flying at heights, times and on routes specifically agreed upon between the
belligerents concerned.
They shall bear, clearly marked, the distinctive emblem prescribed in Article
38, together with their national colours, on their lower, upper and lateral surfaces. They shall be provided with any other markings or means of identification that may be agreed upon between the belligerents upon the outbreak or
during the course of hostilities.
Unless agreed otherwise, flights over enemy or enemy-occupied territory are
prohibited.
Medical aircraft shall obey every summons to land. In the event of a landing thus imposed, the aircraft with its occupants may continue its flight after
examination, if any.
In the event of an involuntary landing in enemy or enemy-occupied territory,
the wounded and sick, as well as the crew of the aircraft shall be prisoners of
war. The medical personnel shall be treated according to Article 24 and the
Articles following.
Article 37
Subject to the provisions of the second paragraph, medical aircraft of Parties
to the conflict may fly over the territory of neutral Powers, land on it in case
of necessity, or use it as a port of call. They shall give the neutral Powers previous notice of their passage over the said territory and obey all summons to
alight, on land or water. They will be immune from attack only when flying on
routes, at heights and at times specifically agreed upon between the Parties to
the conflict and the neutral Power concerned.
The neutral Powers may, however, place conditions or restrictions on the passage or landing of medical aircraft on their territory. Such possible conditions
or restrictions shall be applied equally to all Parties to the conflict.
Unless agreed otherwise between the neutral Power and the Parties to the
conflict, the wounded and sick who are disembarked, with the consent of the
local authorities, on neutral territory by medical aircraft, shall be detained by
the neutral Power, where so required by international law, in such a manner
that they cannot again take part in operations of war. The cost of their accommodation and internment shall be borne by the Power on which they depend.

CHAPTER VII
The Distinctive Emblem
Article 38
As a compliment to Switzerland, the heraldic emblem of the red cross on a
white ground, formed by reversing the Federal colours, is retained as the emblem and distinctive sign of the Medical Service of armed forces.
Nevertheless, in the case of countries which already use as emblem, in place
of the red cross, the red crescent or the red lion and sun1
 on a white ground,
those emblems are also recognized by the terms of the present Convention.
Article 39
Under the direction of the competent military authority, the emblem shall be
displayed on the flags, armlets and on all equipment employed in the Medical
Service.
Article 40
The personnel designated in Article 24 and in Articles 26 and 27 shall wear,
affixed to the left arm, a water-resistant armlet bearing the distinctive emblem, issued and stamped by the military authority.
Such personnel, in addition to wearing the identity disc mentioned in
Article 16, shall also carry a special identity card bearing the distinctive emblem. This card shall be water-resistant and of such size that it can be carried
in the pocket. It shall be worded in the national language, shall mention at
least the surname and first names, the date of birth, the rank and the service
number of the bearer, and shall state in what capacity he is entitled to the
protection of the present Convention. The card shall bear the photograph of
the owner and also either his signature or his finger-prints or both. It shall be
embossed with the stamp of the military authority.
The identity card shall be uniform throughout the same armed forces and, as
far as possible, of a similar type in the armed forces of the High Contracting
Parties. The Parties to the conflict may be guided by the model which is annexed, by way of example, to the present Convention. They shall inform each
other, at the outbreak of hostilities, of the model they are using. Identity cards
should be made out, if possible, at least in duplicate, one copy being kept by
the home country.

and religious

1 The Government of Iran, the only country using the red lion and sun emblem on a white ground,
advised Switzerland, depositary State of the Geneva Conventions, on 4 September 1980, of the
adoption of the red crescent in lieu and place of its former emblem. This was duly communicated by the depositary on 20 October 1980 to the States party to the Geneva Conventions.

50 FIRST CONVENTION
In no circumstances may the said personnel be deprived of their insignia or
identity cards nor of the right to wear the armlet. In case of loss, they shall be
entitled to receive duplicates of the cards and to have the insignia replaced.
Article 41
The personnel designated in Article 25 shall wear, but only while carrying
out medical duties, a white armlet bearing in its centre the distinctive sign in
miniature; the armlet shall be issued and stamped by the military authority.
Military identity documents to be carried by this type of personnel shall
specify what special training they have received, the temporary character of
the duties they are engaged upon, and their authority for wearing the armlet.
Article 42
The distinctive flag of the Convention shall be hoisted only over such medical
units and establishments as are entitled to be respected under the Convention, and only with the consent of the military authorities.
In mobile units, as in fixed establishments, it may be accompanied by the national flag of the Party to the conflict to which the unit or establishment belongs.
Nevertheless, medical units which have fallen into the hands of the enemy
shall not fly any flag other than that of the Convention.
Parties to the conflict shall take the necessary steps, in so far as military considerations permit, to make the distinctive emblems indicating medical units
and establishments clearly visible to the enemy land, air or naval forces, in
order to obviate the possibility of any hostile action.
Article 43
The medical units belonging to neutral countries, which may have been authorized to lend their services to a belligerent under the conditions laid down
in Article 27, shall fly, along with the flag of the Convention, the national flag
of that belligerent, wherever the latter makes use of the faculty conferred on
him by Article 42.
Subject to orders to the contrary by the responsible military authorities, they
may, on all occasions, fly their national flag, even if they fall into the hands of
the adverse Party.
Article 44
With the exception of the cases mentioned in the following paragraphs of the
present Article, the emblem of the red cross on a white ground and the words
“Red Cross”, or “Geneva Cross” may not be employed, either in time of peace
or in time of war, except to indicate or to protect the medical units and establishments, the personnel and material protected by the present Convention

and other Conventions dealing with similar matters. The same shall apply to
the emblems mentioned in Article 38, second paragraph, in respect of the
countries which use them. The National Red Cross Societies and other Societies designated in Article 26 shall have the right to use the distinctive emblem
conferring the protection of the Convention only within the framework of
the present paragraph.
Furthermore, National Red Cross (Red Crescent, Red Lion and Sun) Societies
may, in time of peace, in accordance with their national legislation, make use
of the name and emblem of the Red Cross for their other activities which are
in conformity with the principles laid down by the International Red Cross
Conferences. When those activities are carried out in time of war, the conditions for the use of the emblem shall be such that it cannot be considered as
conferring the protection of the Convention; the emblem shall be comparatively small in size and may not be placed on armlets or on the roofs of buildings.
The international Red Cross organizations and their duly authorized personnel shall be permitted to make use, at all times, of the emblem of the red cross
on a white ground.
As an exceptional measure, in conformity with national legislation and with
the express permission of one of the National Red Cross (Red Crescent, Red
Lion and Sun) Societies, the emblem of the Convention may be employed in
time of peace to identify vehicles used as ambulances and to mark the position of aid stations exclusively assigned to the purpose of giving free treatment to the wounded or sick.
CHAPTER VIII
Execution of the Convention

Article 46
Reprisals against the wounded, sick, personnel, buildings or equipment protected by the Convention are prohibited.
Article 47

respective countries, and, in particular, to include the study thereof in their

Swiss Federal Council and, during hostilities, through the Protecting Powers,
the official translations of the present Convention, as well as the laws and
regulations which they may adopt to ensure the application thereof.
CHAPTER IX
Repression of Abuses and Infractions
Article 49
The High Contracting Parties undertake to enact any legislation necessary to
provide effective penal sanctions for persons committing, or ordering to be
committed, any of the grave breaches of the present Convention defined in
the following Article.
Each High Contracting Party shall be under the obligation to search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, such
grave breaches, and shall bring such persons, regardless of their nationality,
before its own courts. It may also, if it prefers, and in accordance with the
provisions of its own legislation, hand such persons over for trial to another
High Contracting Party concerned, provided such High Contracting Party
has made out a prima facie case.
Each High Contracting Party shall take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the provisions of the present Convention other
than the grave breaches defined in the following Article.
In all circumstances, the accused persons shall benefit by safeguards of proper trial and defence, which shall not be less favourable than those provided
by Article 105 and those following of the Geneva Convention relative to the
Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949.
Article 50
Grave breaches to which the preceding Article relates shall be those involving
any of the following acts, if committed against persons or property protected
by the Convention: wilful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including
biological experiments, wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to
body or health, and extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not
justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly.

Article 51
No High Contracting Party shall be allowed to absolve itself or any other
High Contracting Party of any liability incurred by itself or by another High
Contracting Party in respect of breaches referred to in the preceding Article.
Article 52
At the request of a Party to the conflict, an enquiry shall be instituted, in a
manner to be decided between the interested Parties, concerning any alleged
violation of the Convention.
If agreement has not been reached concerning the procedure for the enquiry,
the Parties should agree on the choice of an umpire who will decide upon the
procedure to be followed.
Once the violation has been established, the Parties to the conflict shall put an
end to it and shall repress it with the least possible delay.
Article 53
The use by individuals, societies, firms or companies either public or private,
other than those entitled thereto under the present Convention, of the emblem or the designation “Red Cross” or “Geneva Cross”, or any sign or designation constituting an imitation thereof, whatever the object of such use, and
irrespective of the date of its adoption, shall be prohibited at all times.
By reason of the tribute paid to Switzerland by the adoption of the reversed
Federal colours, and of the confusion which may arise between the arms of
Switzerland and the distinctive emblem of the Convention, the use by private
individuals, societies or firms, of the arms of the Swiss Confederation, or of
marks constituting an imitation thereof, whether as trademarks or commercial marks, or as parts of such marks, or for a purpose contrary to commercial
honesty, or in circumstances capable of wounding Swiss national sentiment,
shall be prohibited at all times.
Nevertheless, such High Contracting Parties as were not party to the Geneva
Convention of July 27, 1929, may grant to prior users of the emblems, designations, signs or marks designated in the first paragraph, a time limit not to
exceed three years from the coming into force of the present Convention to
discontinue such use, provided that the said use shall not be such as would
appear, in time of war, to confer the protection of the Convention.
The prohibition laid down in the first paragraph of the present Article shall
also apply, without effect on any rights acquired through prior use, to the emblems and marks mentioned in the second paragraph of Article 38.

within or without the zone, directly connected with military operations or the production of
war material.
Article 3
The Power establishing a hospital zone shall take all necessary measures to prohibit access to
all persons who have no right of residence or entry therein.

marked at night by means of appropriate illumination.
Article 7
The Powers shall communicate to all the High Contracting Parties in peacetime or on the

regularly constituted.
If, however, the adverse Party considers that the conditions of the present agreement have not
been fulfilled, it may refuse to recognize the zone by giving immediate notice thereof to the
Party responsible for the said zone, or may make its recognition of such zone dependent upon
the institution of the control provided for in Article 8.
Article 8

of the Red
Cross
64 SECOND CONVENTION
Article 10
The High Contracting Parties may at any time agree to entrust to an organization which offers all guarantees of impartiality and efficacy the duties incumbent on the Protecting Powers by virtue of the present Convention.
When wounded, sick and shipwrecked, or medical personnel and chaplains
do not benefit or cease to benefit, no matter for what reason, by the activities
of a Protecting Power or of an organization provided for in the first paragraph
above, the Detaining Power shall request a neutral State, or such an organization, to undertake the functions performed under the present Convention by
a Protecting Power designated by the Parties to a conflict.
If protection cannot be arranged accordingly, the Detaining Power shall request or shall accept, subject to the provisions of this Article, the offer of the
services of a humanitarian organization, such as the International Committee
of the Red Cross, to assume the humanitarian functions performed by
Protecting Powers under the present Convention.
Any neutral Power, or any organization invited by the Power concerned or
offering itself for these purposes, shall be required to act with a sense of responsibility towards the Party to the conflict on which persons protected by
the present Convention depend, and shall be required to furnish sufficient
assurances that it is in a position to undertake the appropriate functions and
to discharge them impartially.
No derogation from the preceding provisions shall be made by special agreements between Powers one of which is restricted, even temporarily, in its
freedom to negotiate with the other Power or its allies by reason of military
events, more particularly where the whole, or a substantial part, of the territory of the said Power is occupied.
Whenever, in the present Convention, mention is made of a Protecting
Power, such mention also applies to substitute organizations in the sense of
the present Article.
Article 11
In cases where they deem it advisable in the interest of protected persons,
particularly in cases of disagreement between the Parties to the conflict as to
the application or interpretation of the provisions of the present Convention,
the Protecting Powers shall lend their good offices with a view to settling the
disagreement.
For this purpose, each of the Protecting Powers may, either at the invitation
of one Party or on its own initiative, propose to the Parties to the conflict a
meeting of their representatives, in particular of the authorities responsible
for the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, medical personnel and chaplains,
possibly on neutral territory suitably chosen. The Parties to the conflict shall

be bound to give effect to the proposals made to them for this purpose. The
Protecting Powers may, if necessary, propose for approval by the Parties
to the conflict, a person belonging to a neutral Power or delegated by the
International Committee of the Red Cross, who shall be invited to take part
in such a meeting.
CHAPTER II
Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked
Article 12
Members of the armed forces and other persons mentioned in the following
Article, who are at sea and who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances, it being understood that the term
“shipwreck” means shipwreck from any cause and includes forced landings at
sea by or from aircraft.
Such persons shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Parties to the
conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar
criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be
strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated,
subjected to torture or to biological experiments; they shall not wilfully be left
without medical assistance and care, nor shall conditions exposing them to
contagion or infection be created.
Only urgent medical reasons will authorize priority in the order of treatment
to be administered.
Women shall be treated with all consideration due to their sex.
Article 13
The present Convention shall apply to the wounded, sick and shipwrecked at
sea belonging to the following categories:
1) Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict, as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.
2) Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party to the
conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfil the following conditions:
a) that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;
b) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;

c) that of carrying arms openly;
d) that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and
customs of war.
3) Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a Government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power.
4) Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of military aircraft crews, war correspondents, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services
responsible for the welfare of the armed forces, provided that they have
received authorization from the armed forces which they accompany.
5) Members of crews, including masters, pilots and apprentices of the merchant marine and the crews of civil aircraft of the Parties to the conflict,
who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under any other provisions of international law.
6) Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory who, on the approach of the enemy, spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without
having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided
they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war.
Article 14
All warships of a belligerent Party shall have the right to demand that the
wounded, sick or shipwrecked on board military hospital ships, and hospital
ships belonging to relief societies or to private individuals, as well as merchant
vessels, yachts and other craft shall be surrendered, whatever their nationality, provided that the wounded and sick are in a fit state to be moved and that
the warship can provide adequate facilities for necessary medical treatment.
Article 15
If wounded, sick or shipwrecked persons are taken on board a neutral warship or a neutral military aircraft, it shall be ensured, where so required by
international law, that they can take no further part in operations of war.
Article 16
Subject to the provisions of Article 12, the wounded, sick and shipwrecked of
a belligerent who fall into enemy hands shall be prisoners of war, and the provisions of international law concerning prisoners of war shall apply to them.
The captor may decide, according to circumstances, whether it is expedient to
hold them, or to convey them to a port in the captor’s own country, to a neutral port or even to a port in enemy territory. In the last case, prisoners of war
thus returned to their home country may not serve for the duration of the war.

Article 17
Wounded, sick or shipwrecked persons who are landed in neutral ports with
the consent of the local authorities, shall, failing arrangements to the contrary
between the neutral and the belligerent Powers, be so guarded by the neutral
Power, where so required by international law, that the said persons cannot
again take part in operations of war.
The costs of hospital accommodation and internment shall be borne by the
Power on whom the wounded, sick or shipwrecked persons depend.
Article 18
After each engagement, Parties to the conflict shall, without delay, take all
possible measures to search for and collect the shipwrecked, wounded and
sick, to protect them against pillage and ill-treatment, to ensure their adequate care, and to search for the dead and prevent their being despoiled.
Whenever circumstances permit, the Parties to the conflict shall conclude
local arrangements for the removal of the wounded and sick by sea from a
besieged or encircled area and for the passage of medical and religious personnel and equipment on their way to that area.
Article 19
The Parties to the conflict shall record as soon as possible, in respect of each
shipwrecked, wounded, sick or dead person of the adverse Party falling into
their hands, any particulars which may assist in his identification. These
records should if possible include:
a) designation of the Power on which he depends;
b) army, regimental, personal or serial number;
c) surname;
d) first name or names;
e) date of birth;
f) any other particulars shown on his identity card or disc;
g) date and place of capture or death;
h) particulars concerning wounds or illness, or cause of death.
As soon as possible the above-mentioned information shall be forwarded to
the Information Bureau described in Article 122 of the Geneva Convention
relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949, which
shall transmit this information to the Power on which these persons depend through the intermediary of the Protecting Power and of the Central
Prisoners of War Agency.
Parties to the conflict shall prepare and forward to each other through the
same bureau, certificates of death or duly authenticated lists of the dead. They
shall likewise collect and forward through the same bureau one half of the

double identity disc, or the identity disc itself if it is a single disc, last wills
or other documents of importance to the next of kin, money and in general
all articles of an intrinsic or sentimental value, which are found on the dead.
These articles together with unidentified articles, shall be sent in sealed packets, accompanied by statements giving all particulars necessary for the identification of the deceased owners, as well as by a complete list of the contents
of the parcel.
Article 20
Parties to the conflict shall ensure that burial at sea of the dead, carried out
individually as far as circumstances permit, is preceded by a careful examination, if possible by a medical examination, of the bodies, with a view to confirming death, establishing identity and enabling a report to be made. Where
a double identity disc is used, one half of the disc should remain on the body.
If dead persons are landed, the provisions of the Geneva Convention for the
Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in
the Field of August 12, 1949, shall be applicable.
Article 21
The Parties to the conflict may appeal to the charity of commanders of neutral
merchant vessels, yachts or other craft, to take on board and care for wounded, sick or shipwrecked persons, and to collect the dead.
Vessels of any kind responding to this appeal, and those having of their own
accord collected wounded, sick or shipwrecked persons, shall enjoy special
protection and facilities to carry out such assistance.
They may, in no case, be captured on account of any such transport; but, in
the absence of any promise to the contrary, they shall remain liable to capture
for any violations of neutrality they may have committed.
CHAPTER III
Hospital Ships
Article 22
Military hospital ships, that is to say, ships built or equipped by the Powers specially and solely with a view to assisting the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, to treating them and to transporting them, may in no circumstances
be attacked or captured, but shall at all times be respected and protected, on
condition that their names and descriptions have been notified to the Parties
to the conflict ten days before those ships are employed.

Article 23
Establishments ashore entitled to the protection of the Geneva Convention
for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed
Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949, shall be protected from bombardment
or attack from the sea.
Article 24
Hospital ships utilized by National Red Cross Societies, by officially recognized
relief societies or by private persons shall have the same protection as military
hospital ships and shall be exempt from capture, if the Party to the conflict on
which they depend has given them an official commission and in so far as the
provisions of Article 22 concerning notification have been complied with.
These ships must be provided with certificates from the responsible authorities, stating that the vessels have been under their control while fitting out
and on departure.
Article 25
Hospital ships utilized by National Red Cross Societies, officially recognized
relief societies, or private persons of neutral countries shall have the same
protection as military hospital ships and shall be exempt from capture, on
condition that they have placed themselves under the control of one of the
Parties to the conflict, with the previous consent of their own governments
and with the authorization of the Party to the conflict concerned, in so far as
the provisions of Article 22 concerning notification have been complied with.
Article 26
The protection mentioned in Articles 22, 24 and 25 shall apply to hospital
ships of any tonnage and to their lifeboats, wherever they are operating. Nevertheless, to ensure the maximum comfort and security, the Parties to the
conflict shall endeavour to utilize, for the transport of wounded, sick and
shipwrecked over long distances and on the high seas, only hospital ships of
over 2,000 tons gross.
Article 27
Under the same conditions as those provided for in Articles 22 and 24, small
craft employed by the State or by the officially recognized lifeboat institutions
for coastal rescue operations, shall also be respected and protected, so far as
operational requirements permit.

The same shall apply so far as possible to fixed coastal installations used exclusively by these craft for their humanitarian missions.
Article 28
Should fighting occur on board a warship, the sick-bays shall be respected
and spared as far as possible. Sick-bays and their equipment shall remain subject to the laws of warfare, but may not be diverted from their purpose so long
as they are required for the wounded and sick. Nevertheless, the commander
into whose power they have fallen may, after ensuring the proper care of the
wounded and sick who are accommodated therein, apply them to other purposes in case of urgent military necessity.
Article 29
Any hospital ship in a port which falls into the hands of the enemy shall be
authorized to leave the said port.
Article 30
The vessels described in Articles 22, 24, 25 and 27 shall afford relief and assistance to the wounded, sick and shipwrecked without distinction of nationality.
The High Contracting Parties undertake not to use these vessels for any military purpose.
Such vessels shall in no wise hamper the movements of the combatants.
During and after an engagement, they will act at their own risk.
Article 31
The Parties to the conflict shall have the right to control and search the vessels
mentioned in Articles 22, 24, 25 and 27. They can refuse assistance from these
vessels, order them off, make them take a certain course, control the use of
their wireless and other means of communication, and even detain them for
a period not exceeding seven days from the time of interception, if the gravity
of the circumstances so requires.
They may put a commissioner temporarily on board whose sole task shall be
to see that orders given in virtue of the provisions of the preceding paragraph
are carried out.
As far as possible, the Parties to the conflict shall enter in the log of the hospital ship, in a language he can understand, the orders they have given the
captain of the vessel.
Parties to the conflict may, either unilaterally or by particular agreements, put
on board their ships neutral observers who shall verify the strict observation
of the provisions contained in the present Convention.

regards their stay in a neutral port.
Article 33
Merchant vessels which have been transformed into hospital ships cannot be
put to any other use throughout the duration of hostilities.
Article 34
The protection to which hospital ships and sick-bays are entitled shall not
cease unless they are used to commit, outside their humanitarian duties, acts
harmful to the enemy. Protection may, however, cease only after due warning
has been given, naming in all appropriate cases a reasonable time limit, and
after such warning has remained unheeded.
In particular, hospital ships may not possess or use a secret code for their
wireless or other means of communication.
Article 35
The following conditions shall not be considered as depriving hospital ships
or sick-bays of vessels of the protection due to them:
1) The fact that the crews of ships or sick-bays are armed for the maintenance of order, for their own defence or that of the sick and wounded.
2) The presence on board of apparatus exclusively intended to facilitate
navigation or communication.
3) The discovery on board hospital ships or in sick-bays of portable arms
and ammunition taken from the wounded, sick and shipwrecked and
not yet handed to the proper service.
4) The fact that the humanitarian activities of hospital ships and sick-bays
of vessels or of the crews extend to the care of wounded, sick or shipwrecked civilians.
5) The transport of equipment and of personnel intended exclusively for
medical duties, over and above the normal requirements.

CHAPTER IV
Personnel
Article 36
The religious, medical and hospital personnel of hospital ships and their
crews shall be respected and protected; they may not be captured during the
time they are in the service of the hospital ship, whether or not there are
wounded and sick on board.
Article 37
The religious, medical and hospital personnel assigned to the medical or spiritual care of the persons designated in Articles 12 and 13 shall, if they fall into
the hands of the enemy, be respected and protected; they may continue to
carry out their duties as long as this is necessary for the care of the wounded
and sick. They shall afterwards be sent back as soon as the Commander-inChief, under whose authority they are, considers it practicable. They may take
with them, on leaving the ship, their personal property.
If, however, it proves necessary to retain some of this personnel owing to the
medical or spiritual needs of prisoners of war, everything possible shall be
done for their earliest possible landing.
Retained personnel shall be subject, on landing, to the provisions of the
Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded
and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949.
CHAPTER V
Medical Transports
Article 38
Ships chartered for that purpose shall be authorized to transport equipment
exclusively intended for the treatment of wounded and sick members of
armed forces or for the prevention of disease, provided that the particulars
regarding their voyage have been notified to the adverse Power and approved
by the latter. The adverse Power shall preserve the right to board the carrier
ships, but not to capture them or to seize the equipment carried.
By agreement amongst the Parties to the conflict, neutral observers may be
placed on board such ships to verify the equipment carried. For this purpose,
free access to the equipment shall be given.

Article 39
Medical aircraft, that is to say, aircraft exclusively employed for the removal of
wounded, sick and shipwrecked, and for the transport of medical personnel
and equipment, may not be the object of attack, but shall be respected by the
Parties to the conflict, while flying at heights, at times and on routes specifically agreed upon between the Parties to the conflict concerned.
They shall be clearly marked with the distinctive emblem prescribed in
Article 41, together with their national colours, on their lower, upper and
lateral surfaces. They shall be provided with any other markings or means of
identification which may be agreed upon between the Parties to the conflict
upon the outbreak or during the course of hostilities.
Unless agreed otherwise, flights over enemy or enemy-occupied territory are
prohibited.
Medical aircraft shall obey every summons to alight on land or water. In the
event of having thus to alight, the aircraft with its occupants may continue its
flight after examination, if any.
In the event of alighting involuntarily on land or water in enemy or enemyoccupied territory, the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, as well as the crew of
the aircraft shall be prisoners of war. The medical personnel shall be treated
according to Articles 36 and 37.
Article 40
Subject to the provisions of the second paragraph, medical aircraft of Parties to the conflict may fly over the territory of neutral Powers, land thereon
in case of necessity, or use it as a port of call. They shall give neutral Powers
prior notice of their passage over the said territory, and obey every summons
to alight, on land or water. They will be immune from attack only when flying
on routes, at heights and at times specifically agreed upon between the Parties
to the conflict and the neutral Power concerned.
The neutral Powers may, however, place conditions or restrictions on the passage or landing of medical aircraft on their territory. Such possible conditions
or restrictions shall be applied equally to all Parties to the conflict.
Unless otherwise agreed between the neutral Powers and the Parties to the
conflict, the wounded, sick or shipwrecked who are disembarked with the
consent of the local authorities on neutral territory by medical aircraft shall
be detained by the neutral Power, where so required by international law,
in such a manner that they cannot again take part in operations of war. The
cost of their accommodation and internment shall be borne by the Power on
which they depend.

CHAPTER VI
The Distinctive Emblem
Article 41
Under the direction of the competent military authority, the emblem of the
red cross on a white ground shall be displayed on the flags, armlets and on all
equipment employed in the Medical Service.
Nevertheless, in the case of countries which already use as emblem, in place
of the red cross, the red crescent or the red lion and sun on a white ground,
these emblems are also recognized by the terms of the present Convention.
Article 42
The personnel designated in Articles 36 and 37 shall wear, affixed to the left
arm, a water-resistant armlet bearing the distinctive emblem, issued and
stamped by the military authority.
Such personnel, in addition to wearing the identity disc mentioned in
Article 19, shall also carry a special identity card bearing the distinctive emblem. This card shall be water-resistant and of such size that it can be carried
in the pocket. It shall be worded in the national language, shall mention at
least the surname and first names, the date of birth, the rank and the service
number of the bearer, and shall state in what capacity he is entitled to the
protection of the present Convention. The card shall bear the photograph of
the owner and also either his signature or his finger-prints or both. It shall be
embossed with the stamp of the military authority.
The identity card shall be uniform throughout the same armed forces and, as
far as possible, of a similar type in the armed forces of the High Contracting
Parties. The Parties to the conflict may be guided by the model which is annexed, by way of example, to the present Convention. They shall inform each
other, at the outbreak of hostilities, of the model they are using. Identity cards
should be made out, if possible, at least in duplicate, one copy being kept by
the home country.
In no circumstances may the said personnel be deprived of their insignia or
identity cards nor of the right to wear the armlet. In cases of loss they shall be
entitled to receive duplicates of the cards and to have the insignia replaced.
Article 43
The ships designated in Articles 22, 24, 25 and 27 shall be distinctively marked
as follows:
a) All exterior surfaces shall be white.
b) One or more dark red crosses, as large as possible, shall be painted
and displayed on each side of the hull and on the horizontal surfaces,

so placed as to afford the greatest possible visibility from the sea and
from the air.
All hospital ships shall make themselves known by hoisting their national flag
and further, if they belong to a neutral state, the flag of the Party to the conflict whose direction they have accepted. A white flag with a red cross shall be
flown at the mainmast as high as possible.
Lifeboats of hospital ships, coastal lifeboats and all small craft used by the
Medical Service shall be painted white with dark red crosses prominently displayed and shall, in general, comply with the identification system prescribed
above for hospital ships.
The above-mentioned ships and craft, which may wish to ensure by night and
in times of reduced visibility the protection to which they are entitled, must,
subject to the assent of the Party to the conflict under whose power they are,
take the necessary measures to render their painting and distinctive emblems
sufficiently apparent.
Hospital ships which, in accordance with Article 31, are provisionally detained by the enemy, must haul down the flag of the Party to the conflict in
whose service they are or whose direction they have accepted.
Coastal lifeboats, if they continue to operate with the consent of the Occupying
Power from a base which is occupied, may be allowed, when away from their
base, to continue to fly their own national colours along with a flag carrying a
red cross on a white ground, subject to prior notification to all the Parties to
the conflict concerned.
All the provisions in this Article relating to the red cross shall apply equally to
the other emblems mentioned in Article 41.
Parties to the conflict shall at all times endeavour to conclude mutual agreements, in order to use the most modern methods available to facilitate the
identification of hospital ships.
Article 44
The distinguishing signs referred to in Article 43 can only be used, whether in
time of peace or war, for indicating or protecting the ships therein mentioned,
except as may be provided in any other international Convention or by agreement between all the Parties to the conflict concerned.
Article 45
The High Contracting Parties shall, if their legislation is not already adequate,
take the measures necessary for the prevention and repression, at all times, of
any abuse of the distinctive signs provided for under Article 43.

The High Contracting Parties undertake, in time of peace as in time of war, to
disseminate the text of the present Convention as widely as possible in their
respective countries, and, in particular, to include the study thereof in their
programmes of military and, if possible, civil instruction, so that the principles thereof may become known to the entire population, in particular to the
armed fighting forces, the medical personnel and the chaplains.
Article 49
The High Contracting Parties shall communicate to one another through the
Swiss Federal Council and, during hostilities, through the Protecting Powers,
the official translations of the present Convention, as well as the laws and
regulations which they may adopt to ensure the application thereof.
CHAPTER VIII
Repression of Abuses and Infractions
Article 50
The High Contracting Parties undertake to enact any legislation necessary to
provide effective penal sanctions for persons committing, or ordering to be
committed, any of the grave breaches of the present Convention defined in
the following Article.
Each High Contracting Party shall be under the obligation to search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, such
grave breaches, and shall bring such persons, regardless of their nationality,
before its own courts. It may also, if it prefers, and in accordance with the
provisions of its own legislation, hand such persons over for trial to another
High Contracting Party concerned, provided such High Contracting Party
has made out a prima facie case.

than the grave breaches defined in the following Article.
In all circumstances, the accused persons shall benefit by safeguards of proper trial and defence, which shall not be less favourable than those provided
by Article 105 and those following of the Geneva Convention relative to the

body or health, and extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not
justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly.
Article 52
No High Contracting Party shall be allowed to absolve itself or any other
High Contracting Party of any liability incurred by itself or by another High
Contracting Party in respect of breaches referred to in the preceding Article.
Article 53
At the request of a Party to the conflict, an enquiry shall be instituted, in a
manner to be decided between the interested Parties, concerning any alleged
violation of the Convention.
If agreement has not been reached concerning the procedure for the enquiry,

Article 55
The present Convention, which bears the date of this day, is open to signature

The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of
the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets
with no armed resistance.
Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present

their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in
relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof.

other similar criteria.
To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time
and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons:
a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;
b) taking of hostages;

An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee
of the Red Cross, may offer its services to the Parties to the conflict.
The Parties to the conflict should further endeavour to bring into force,
by means of special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the
present Convention.
The application of the preceding provisions shall not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict.

belonging to one of the following categories, who have fallen into the power
of the enemy:
1) Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.
2) Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party to the
conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this territory is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfil the following conditions:
a) that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;
b) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;
c) that of carrying arms openly;
d) that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and
customs of war.
3) Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power.
Prisoners

THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 83
4) Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of military aircraft crews, war correspondents, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services
responsible for the welfare of the armed forces, provided that they have
received authorization from the armed forces which they accompany,
who shall provide them for that purpose with an identity card similar to
the annexed model.
5) Members of crews, including masters, pilots and apprentices of the merchant marine and the crews of civil aircraft of the Parties to the conflict,
who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under any other provisions of international law.
6) Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory who, on the approach of the enemy, spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without
having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided
they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war.
B. The following shall likewise be treated as prisoners of war under the present Convention:
1) Persons belonging, or having belonged, to the armed forces of the occupied country, if the occupying Power considers it necessary by reason of
such allegiance to intern them, even though it has originally liberated them
while hostilities were going on outside the territory it occupies, in particular
where such persons have made an unsuccessful attempt to rejoin the armed
forces to which they belong and which are engaged in combat, or where they
fail to comply with a summons made to them with a view to internment.
2) The persons belonging to one of the categories enumerated in the present Article, who have been received by neutral or non-belligerent Powers
on their territory and whom these Powers are required to intern under
international law, without prejudice to any more favourable treatment
which these Powers may choose to give and with the exception of Articles 8, 10, 15, 30, fifth paragraph, 58-67, 92, 126 and, where diplomatic
relations exist between the Parties to the conflict and the neutral or nonbelligerent Power concerned, those Articles concerning the Protecting
Power. Where such diplomatic relations exist, the Parties to a conflict on
whom these persons depend shall be allowed to perform towards them
the functions of a Protecting Power as provided in the present Convention, without prejudice to the functions which these Parties normally exercise in conformity with diplomatic and consular usage and treaties.
C. This Article shall in no way affect the status of medical personnel and
chaplains as provided for in Article 33 of the present Convention.
84 THIRD CONVENTION
Article 5
The present Convention shall apply to the persons referred to in Article 4
from the time they fall into the power of the enemy and until their final release and repatriation.
Should any doubt arise as to whether persons having committed a belligerent
act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy belong to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4, such persons shall enjoy the protection of the
present Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a
competent tribunal.
Article 6
In addition to the agreements expressly provided for in Articles 10, 23, 28, 33,
60, 65, 66, 67, 72, 73, 75, 109, 110, 118, 119, 122 and 132, the High Contracting Parties may conclude other special agreements for all matters concerning which they may deem it suitable to make separate provision. No special
agreement shall adversely affect the situation of prisoners of war, as defined
by the present Convention, nor restrict the rights which it confers upon them.
Prisoners of war shall continue to have the benefit of such agreements as long
as the Convention is applicable to them, except where express provisions to
the contrary are contained in the aforesaid or in subsequent agreements, or
where more favourable measures have been taken with regard to them by one
or other of the Parties to the conflict.
Article 7
Prisoners of war may in no circumstances renounce in part or in entirety the
rights secured to them by the present Convention, and by the special agreements referred to in the foregoing Article, if such there be.
Article 8
The present Convention shall be applied with the co-operation and under the
scrutiny of the Protecting Powers whose duty it is to safeguard the interests
of the Parties to the conflict. For this purpose, the Protecting Powers may appoint, apart from their diplomatic or consular staff, delegates from amongst
their own nationals or the nationals of other neutral Powers. The said delegates shall be subject to the approval of the Power with which they are to
carry out their duties.
The Parties to the conflict shall facilitate to the greatest extent possible the
task of the representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers.
The representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers shall not in any case
exceed their mission under the present Convention. They shall, in particular,

take account of the imperative necessities of security of the State wherein they
carry out their duties.
Article 9
The provisions of the present Convention constitute no obstacle to the humanitarian activities which the International Committee of the Red Cross or
any other impartial humanitarian organization may, subject to the consent of
the Parties to the conflict concerned, undertake for the protection of prisoners of war and for their relief.
Article 10
The High Contracting Parties may at any time agree to entrust to an organization which offers all guarantees of impartiality and efficacy the duties incumbent on the Protecting Powers by virtue of the present Convention.
When prisoners of war do not benefit or cease to benefit, no matter for what
reason, by the activities of a Protecting Power or of an organization provided
for in the first paragraph above, the Detaining Power shall request a neutral
State, or such an organization, to undertake the functions performed under
the present Convention by a Protecting Power designated by the Parties to a
conflict.
If protection cannot be arranged accordingly, the Detaining Power shall request or shall accept, subject to the provisions of this Article, the offer of the
services of a humanitarian organization, such as the International Committee
of the Red Cross, to assume the humanitarian functions performed by
Protecting Powers under the present Convention.
Any neutral Power or any organization invited by the Power concerned or
offering itself for these purposes, shall be required to act with a sense of responsibility towards the Party to the conflict on which persons protected by
the present Convention depend, and shall be required to furnish sufficient
assurances that it is in a position to undertake the appropriate functions and
to discharge them impartially.
No derogation from the preceding provisions shall be made by special agreements between Powers one of which is restricted, even temporarily, in its
freedom to negotiate with the other Power or its allies by reason of military
events, more particularly where the whole, or a substantial part, of the territory of the said Power is occupied.
Whenever in the present Convention mention is made of a Protecting Power,
such mention applies to substitute organizations in the sense of the present
Article.

Article 11
In cases where they deem it advisable in the interest of protected persons,
particularly in cases of disagreement between the Parties to the conflict as to
the application or interpretation of the provisions of the present Convention,
the Protecting Powers shall lend their good offices with a view to settling the
disagreement.
For this purpose, each of the Protecting Powers may, either at the invitation
of one Party or on its own initiative, propose to the Parties to the conflict a
meeting of their representatives, and in particular of the authorities responsible for prisoners of war, possibly on neutral territory suitably chosen. The
Parties to the conflict shall be bound to give effect to the proposals made to
them for this purpose. The Protecting Powers may, if necessary, propose for
approval by the Parties to the conflict a person belonging to a neutral Power,
or delegated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, who shall be
invited to take part in such a meeting.
PART II
General Protection of Prisoners of War
Article 12
Prisoners of war are in the hands of the enemy Power, but not of the individuals or military units who have captured them. Irrespective of the individual
responsibilities that may exist, the Detaining Power is responsible for the
treatment given them.
Prisoners of war may only be transferred by the Detaining Power to a Power
which is a party to the Convention and after the Detaining Power has satisfied itself of the willingness and ability of such transferee Power to apply the
Convention. When prisoners of war are transferred under such circumstances, responsibility for the application of the Convention rests on the Power
accepting them while they are in its custody.
Nevertheless if that Power fails to carry out the provisions of the Convention
in any important respect, the Power by whom the prisoners of war were
transferred shall, upon being notified by the Protecting Power, take effective
measures to correct the situation or shall request the return of the prisoners
of war. Such requests must be complied with.

THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 87
Article 13
Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated. Any unlawful act or
omission by the Detaining Power causing death or seriously endangering the
health of a prisoner of war in its custody is prohibited, and will be regarded
as a serious breach of the present Convention. In particular, no prisoner of
war may be subjected to physical mutilation or to medical or scientific experiments of any kind which are not justified by the medical, dental or hospital
treatment of the prisoner concerned and carried out in his interest.
Likewise, prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against
acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity.
Measures of reprisal against prisoners of war are prohibited.
Article 14
Prisoners of war are entitled in all circumstances to respect for their persons
and their honour.
Women shall be treated with all the regard due to their sex and shall in all
cases benefit by treatment as favourable as that granted to men.
Prisoners of war shall retain the full civil capacity which they enjoyed at the
time of their capture. The Detaining Power may not restrict the exercise, either within or without its own territory, of the rights such capacity confers
except in so far as the captivity requires.
Article 15
The Power detaining prisoners of war shall be bound to provide free of charge
for their maintenance and for the medical attention required by their state of
health.
Article 16
Taking into consideration the provisions of the present Convention relating
to rank and sex, and subject to any privileged treatment which may be accorded to them by reason of their state of health, age or professional qualifications, all prisoners of war shall be treated alike by the Detaining Power,
without any adverse distinction based on race, nationality, religious belief or
political opinions, or any other distinction founded on similar criteria.

Captivity
SECTION I
Beginning of captivity
Article 17
Every prisoner of war, when questioned on the subject, is bound to give only
his surname, first names and rank, date of birth, and army, regimental, personal or serial number, or failing this, equivalent information.
If he wilfully infringes this rule, he may render himself liable to a restriction
of the privileges accorded to his rank or status.
Each Party to a conflict is required to furnish the persons under its jurisdiction who are liable to become prisoners of war, with an identity card showing
the owner’s surname, first names, rank, army, regimental, personal or serial
number or equivalent information, and date of birth. The identity card may,
furthermore, bear the signature or the finger-prints, or both, of the owner,
and may bear, as well, any other information the Party to the conflict may
wish to add concerning persons belonging to its armed forces. As far as possible the card shall measure 6.5 x 10 cm and shall be issued in duplicate. The
identity card shall be shown by the prisoner of war upon demand, but may in
no case be taken away from him.
No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever.
Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted, or
exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.
Prisoners of war who, owing to their physical or mental condition, are unable
to state their identity, shall be handed over to the medical service. The identity of such prisoners shall be established by all possible means, subject to the
provisions of the preceding paragraph.
The questioning of prisoners of war shall be carried out in a language which
they understand.
Article 18
All effects and articles of personal use, except arms, horses, military equipment and military documents, shall remain in the possession of prisoners
of war, likewise their metal helmets and gas masks and like articles issued
for personal protection. Effects and articles used for their clothing or feeding shall likewise remain in their possession, even if such effects and articles
belong to their regulation military equipment.

Property of

THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 89
At no time should prisoners of war be without identity documents. The
Detaining Power shall supply such documents to prisoners of war who possess none.
Badges of rank and nationality, decorations and articles having above all a
personal or sentimental value may not be taken from prisoners of war.
Sums of money carried by prisoners of war may not be taken away from them
except by order of an officer, and after the amount and particulars of the owner have been recorded in a special register and an itemized receipt has been
given, legibly inscribed with the name, rank and unit of the person issuing
the said receipt. Sums in the currency of the Detaining Power, or which are
changed into such currency at the prisoner’s request, shall be placed to the
credit of the prisoner’s account as provided in Article 64.
The Detaining Power may withdraw articles of value from prisoners of war
only for reasons of security; when such articles are withdrawn, the procedure
laid down for sums of money impounded shall apply.
Such objects, likewise the sums taken away in any currency other than that of
the Detaining Power and the conversion of which has not been asked for by
the owners, shall be kept in the custody of the Detaining Power and shall be
returned in their initial shape to prisoners of war at the end of their captivity.
Article 19
Prisoners of war shall be evacuated, as soon as possible after their capture, to
camps situated in an area far enough from the combat zone for them to be
out of danger.
Only those prisoners of war who, owing to wounds or sickness, would run
greater risks by being evacuated than by remaining where they are, may be
temporarily kept back in a danger zone.
Prisoners of war shall not be unnecessarily exposed to danger while awaiting
evacuation from a fighting zone.
Article 20
The evacuation of prisoners of war shall always be effected humanely and
in conditions similar to those for the forces of the Detaining Power in their
changes of station.
The Detaining Power shall supply prisoners of war who are being evacuated
with sufficient food and potable water, and with the necessary clothing and
medical attention. The Detaining Power shall take all suitable precautions to
ensure their safety during evacuation, and shall establish as soon as possible a
list of the prisoners of war who are evacuated.

90 THIRD CONVENTION
If prisoners of war must, during evacuation, pass through transit camps, their
stay in such camps shall be as brief as possible.
SECTION II
Internment of Prisoners of War
CHAPTER I
General Observations
Article 21
The Detaining Power may subject prisoners of war to internment. It may impose on them the obligation of not leaving, beyond certain limits, the camp
where they are interned, or if the said camp is fenced in, of not going outside its
perimeter. Subject to the provisions of the present Convention relative to penal
and disciplinary sanctions, prisoners of war may not be held in close confinement except where necessary to safeguard their health and then only during
the continuation of the circumstances which make such confinement necessary.
Prisoners of war may be partially or wholly released on parole or promise,
in so far as is allowed by the laws of the Power on which they depend. Such
measures shall be taken particularly in cases where this may contribute to the
improvement of their state of health. No prisoner of war shall be compelled
to accept liberty on parole or promise.
Upon the outbreak of hostilities, each Party to the conflict shall notify the adverse Party of the laws and regulations allowing or forbidding its own nationals to accept liberty on parole or promise. Prisoners of war who are paroled
or who have given their promise in conformity with the laws and regulations
so notified, are bound on their personal honour scrupulously to fulfil, both
towards the Power on which they depend and towards the Power which has
captured them, the engagements of their paroles or promises. In such cases,
the Power on which they depend is bound neither to require nor to accept
from them any service incompatible with the parole or promise given.
Article 22
Prisoners of war may be interned only in premises located on land and affording every guarantee of hygiene and healthfulness. Except in particular cases
which are justified by the interest of the prisoners themselves, they shall not
be interned in penitentiaries.
Prisoners of war interned in unhealthy areas, or where the climate is injurious
for them, shall be removed as soon as possible to a more favourable climate.

Places and
conditions of

THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 91
The Detaining Power shall assemble prisoners of war in camps or camp compounds according to their nationality, language and customs, provided that
such prisoners shall not be separated from prisoners of war belonging to the
armed forces with which they were serving at the time of their capture, except
with their consent.
Article 23
No prisoner of war may at any time be sent to, or detained in areas where he
may be exposed to the fire of the combat zone, nor may his presence be used
to render certain points or areas immune from military operations.
Prisoners of war shall have shelters against air bombardment and other hazards of war, to the same extent as the local civilian population. With the exception of those engaged in the protection of their quarters against the aforesaid
hazards, they may enter such shelters as soon as possible after the giving of
the alarm. Any other protective measure taken in favour of the population
shall also apply to them.
Detaining Powers shall give the Powers concerned, through the intermediary
of the Protecting Powers, all useful information regarding the geographical
location of prisoner of war camps.
Whenever military considerations permit, prisoner of war camps shall be indicated in the day-time by the letters PW or PG, placed so as to be clearly visible from the air. The Powers concerned may, however, agree upon any other
system of marking. Only prisoner of war camps shall be marked as such.
Article 24
Transit or screening camps of a permanent kind shall be fitted out under conditions similar to those described in the present Section, and the prisoners
therein shall have the same treatment as in other camps.
CHAPTER II
Quarters, Food and Clothing of Prisoners of War
Article 25
Prisoners of war shall be quartered under conditions as favourable as those
for the forces of the Detaining Power who are billeted in the same area. The
said conditions shall make allowance for the habits and customs of the prisoners and shall in no case be prejudicial to their health.
The foregoing provisions shall apply in particular to the dormitories of prisoners of war as regards both total surface and minimum cubic space, and the
general installations, bedding and blankets.

Quarters
92 THIRD CONVENTION
The premises provided for the use of prisoners of war individually or collectively, shall be entirely protected from dampness and adequately heated and
lighted, in particular between dusk and lights out. All precautions must be
taken against the danger of fire.
In any camps in which women prisoners of war, as well as men, are accommodated, separate dormitories shall be provided for them.
Article 26
The basic daily food rations shall be sufficient in quantity, quality and variety
to keep prisoners of war in good health and to prevent loss of weight or the
development of nutritional deficiencies. Account shall also be taken of the
habitual diet of the prisoners.
The Detaining Power shall supply prisoners of war who work with such additional rations as are necessary for the labour on which they are employed.
Sufficient drinking water shall be supplied to prisoners of war. The use of
tobacco shall be permitted.
Prisoners of war shall, as far as possible, be associated with the preparation of their meals; they may be employed for that purpose in the kitchens.
Furthermore, they shall be given the means of preparing, themselves, the additional food in their possession.
Adequate premises shall be provided for messing.
Collective disciplinary measures affecting food are prohibited.
Article 27
Clothing, underwear and footwear shall be supplied to prisoners of war in
sufficient quantities by the Detaining Power, which shall make allowance for
the climate of the region where the prisoners are detained. Uniforms of enemy armed forces captured by the Detaining Power should, if suitable for the
climate, be made available to clothe prisoners of war.
The regular replacement and repair of the above articles shall be assured by
the Detaining Power. In addition, prisoners of war who work shall receive appropriate clothing, wherever the nature of the work demands.
Article 28
Canteens shall be installed in all camps, where prisoners of war may procure
foodstuffs, soap and tobacco and ordinary articles in daily use. The tariff shall
never be in excess of local market prices.
The profits made by camp canteens shall be used for the benefit of the prisoners; a special fund shall be created for this purpose. The prisoners’ representaClothing
Canteens
Food
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 93
tive shall have the right to collaborate in the management of the canteen and
of this fund.
When a camp is closed down, the credit balance of the special fund shall be
handed to an international welfare organization, to be employed for the benefit of prisoners of war of the same nationality as those who have contributed
to the fund. In case of a general repatriation, such profits shall be kept by
the Detaining Power, subject to any agreement to the contrary between the
Powers concerned.
CHAPTER III
Hygiene and Medical Attention
Article 29
The Detaining Power shall be bound to take all sanitary measures necessary to
ensure the cleanliness and healthfulness of camps, and to prevent epidemics.
Prisoners of war shall have for their use, day and night, conveniences which
conform to the rules of hygiene and are maintained in a constant state of
cleanliness. In any camps in which women prisoners of war are accommodated, separate conveniences shall be provided for them.
Also, apart from the baths and showers with which the camps shall be furnished, prisoners of war shall be provided with sufficient water and soap for
their personal toilet and for washing their personal laundry; the necessary
installations, facilities and time shall be granted them for that purpose.
Article 30
Every camp shall have an adequate infirmary where prisoners of war may

Prisoners of war who, though not attached to the medical service of their
armed forces, are physicians, surgeons, dentists, nurses or medical orderlies,

Power are transferred. Account shall always be taken of the climatic conditions to which the prisoners of war are accustomed and the conditions of
transfer shall in no case be prejudicial to their health.
The Detaining Power shall supply prisoners of war during transfer with sufficient food and drinking water to keep them in good health, likewise with
the necessary clothing, shelter and medical attention. The Detaining Power
shall take adequate precautions especially in case of transport by sea or by air,
to ensure their safety during transfer, and shall draw up a complete list of all
transferred prisoners before their departure.
Article 47
Sick or wounded prisoners of war shall not be transferred as long as their
recovery may be endangered by the journey, unless their safety imperatively
demands it.

In the event of transfer, prisoners of war shall be officially advised of their
departure and of their new postal address. Such notifications shall be given in
time for them to pack their luggage and inform their next of kin.

baggage may be limited, if the conditions of transfer so require, to what each
prisoner can reasonably carry, which shall in no case be more than twentyfive kilograms per head.
Mail and parcels addressed to their former camp shall be forwarded to them
without delay. The camp commander shall take, in agreement with the prisoners’ representative, any measures needed to ensure the transport of the

be converted into any other currency without their consent.
If prisoners of war are permitted to purchase services or commodities outside the camp against payment in cash, such payments shall be made by the

necessary rules in this respect.
Article 59
Cash which was taken from prisoners of war, in accordance with Article 18, at
the time of their capture, and which is in the currency of the Detaining Power,
shall be placed to their separate accounts, in accordance with the provisions
of Article 64 of the present Section.

of sums in other currencies that are taken from the prisoners of war at the
same time, shall also be credited to their separate accounts.
Article 60
The Detaining Power shall grant all prisoners of war a monthly advance of

unduly high compared with the pay of the Detaining Power’s armed forces or
would, for any reason, seriously embarrass the Detaining Power, then, pending the conclusion of a special agreement with the Power on which the prisoners depend to vary the amounts indicated above, the Detaining Power:
a) shall continue to credit the accounts of the prisoners with the
amounts indicated in the first paragraph above;
104 THIRD CONVENTION
b) may temporarily limit the amount made available from these advances of pay to prisoners of war for their own use, to sums which

each prisoner of the same category, shall be payable to all prisoners of that
category depending on that Power, and shall be placed in their separate accounts, at the earliest opportunity, in accordance with the provisions of Article 64. Such supplementary pay shall not relieve the Detaining Power of any
obligation under this Convention.
Article 62
Prisoners of war shall be paid a fair working rate of pay by the detaining
authorities direct. The rate shall be fixed by the said authorities, but shall at
no time be less than one-fourth of one Swiss franc for a full working day. The

they depend, through the intermediary of the Protecting Power, of the rate of
daily working pay that it has fixed.
Working pay shall likewise be paid by the detaining authorities to prisoners of
war permanently detailed to duties or to a skilled or semi-skilled occupation

on behalf of their comrades.
The working pay of the prisoners’ representative, of his advisers, if any, and
of his assistants, shall be paid out of the fund maintained by canteen profits.

the termination of his captivity.
Article 67
Advances of pay, issued to prisoners of war in conformity with Article 60,
shall be considered as made on behalf of the Power on which they depend.

This statement will be signed by a responsible officer of the Detaining Power
and the medical particulars certified by a medical officer.
Any claim by a prisoner of war for compensation in respect of personal effects,
monies or valuables impounded by the Detaining Power under Article 18 and

such effects, monies or valuables have not been restored to him. A copy of this
statement will be forwarded to the Power on which he depends through the
Central Prisoners of War Agency provided for in Article 123.
SECTION V
Relations of prisoners of war with the exterior
Article 69
Immediately upon prisoners of war falling into its power, the Detaining Power shall inform them and the Powers on which they depend, through the Protecting Power, of the measures taken to carry out the provisions of the present
Section. They shall likewise inform the parties concerned of any subsequent
modifications of such measures.
Article 70
Immediately upon capture, or not more than one week after arrival at a camp,
even if it is a transit camp, likewise in case of sickness or transfer to hospital
or another camp, every prisoner of war shall be enabled to write direct to his
family, on the one hand, and to the Central Prisoners of War Agency provided
for in Article 123, on the other hand, a card similar, if possible, to the model

address and state of health. The said cards shall be forwarded as rapidly as
possible and may not be delayed in any manner.
Article 71
Prisoners of war shall be allowed to send and receive letters and cards. If
the Detaining Power deems it necessary to limit the number of letters and
cards sent by each prisoner of war, the said number shall not be less than two
letters and four cards monthly, exclusive of the capture cards provided for
in Article 70, and conforming as closely as possible to the models annexed
to the present Convention. Further limitations may be imposed only if the
Protecting Power is satisfied that it would be in the interests of the prisoners
of war concerned to do so owing to difficulties of translation caused by the
Detaining Power’s inability to find sufficient qualified linguists to carry out
the necessary censorship. If limitations must be placed on the correspondence addressed to prisoners of war, they may be ordered only by the Power on
which the prisoners depend, possibly at the request of the Detaining Power.

homes, shall be permitted to send telegrams, the fees being charged against
the prisoners of war’s accounts with the Detaining Power or paid in the currency at their disposal. They shall likewise benefit by this measure in cases of
urgency.
As a general rule, the correspondence of prisoners of war shall be written in
their native language. The Parties to the conflict may allow correspondence
in other languages.
Sacks containing prisoner of war mail must be securely sealed and labelled
so as clearly to indicate their contents, and must be addressed to offices of
destination.
Article 72
Prisoners of war shall be allowed to receive by post or by any other means individual parcels or collective shipments containing, in particular, foodstuffs,
clothing, medical supplies and articles of a religious, educational or recreational character which may meet their needs, including books, devotional articles scientific equipment, examination papers, musical instruments, sports
outfits and materials allowing prisoners of war to pursue their studies or their
cultural activities.
Such shipments shall in no way free the Detaining Power from the obligations
imposed upon it by virtue of the present Convention.
The only limits which may be placed on these shipments shall be those proposed by the Protecting Power in the interest of the prisoners themselves, or
by the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other organization
giving assistance to the prisoners, in respect of their own shipments only, on
account of exceptional strain on transport or communications.
The conditions for the sending of individual parcels and collective relief
shall, if necessary, be the subject of special agreements between the Powers
concerned, which may in no case delay the receipt by the prisoners of relief
supplies. Books may not be included in parcels of clothing and foodstuffs.
Medical supplies shall, as a rule, be sent in collective parcels.

rules and regulations concerning collective shipments, which are annexed to
the present Convention, shall be applied.
The special agreements referred to above shall in no case restrict the right
of prisoners’ representatives to take possession of collective relief shipments
intended for prisoners of war, to proceed to their distribution or to dispose of
them in the interest of the prisoners.
Nor shall such agreements restrict the right of representatives of the Protecting
Power, the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other organization giving assistance to prisoners of war and responsible for the forwarding
of collective shipments, to supervise their distribution to the recipients.
Article 74
All relief shipments for prisoners of war shall be exempt from import, customs and other dues.
Correspondence, relief shipments and authorized remittances of money addressed to prisoners of war or despatched by them through the post office,
either direct or through the Information Bureaux provided for in Article 122
and the Central Prisoners of War Agency provided for in Article 123, shall be
exempt from any postal dues, both in the countries of origin and destination,
and in intermediate countries.
If relief shipments intended for prisoners of war cannot be sent through the
post office by reason of weight or for any other cause, the cost of transportation shall be borne by the Detaining Power in all the territories under its control. The other Powers party to the Convention shall bear the cost of transport
in their respective territories.
In the absence of special agreements between the Parties concerned, the costs
connected with transport of such shipments, other than costs covered by the
above exemption, shall be charged to the senders.
The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to reduce, so far as possible,
the rates charged for telegrams sent by prisoners of war, or addressed to them.
Article 75
Should military operations prevent the Powers concerned from fulfilling their
obligation to assure the transport of the shipments referred to in Articles 70,
71, 72 and 77, the Protecting Powers concerned, the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other organization duly approved by the Parties
to the conflict may undertake to ensure the conveyance of such shipments by
suitable means (railway wagons, motor vehicles, vessels or aircraft, etc.). For
this purpose, the High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to supply them
with such transport and to allow its circulation, especially by granting the
necessary safe-conducts.
Special
means of
transport
110 THIRD CONVENTION
Such transport may also be used to convey:
a) correspondence, lists and reports exchanged between the Central
Information Agency referred to in Article 123 and the National Bureaux referred to in Article 122;
b) correspondence and reports relating to prisoners of war which the
Protecting Power, the International Committee of the Red Cross or
any other body assisting the prisoners, exchange either with their
own delegates or with the Parties to the conflict.
These provisions in no way detract from the right of any Party to the conflict
to arrange other means of transport, if it should so prefer, nor preclude the
granting of safe-conducts, under mutually agreed conditions, to such means
of transport.
In the absence of special agreements, the costs occasioned by the use of such
means of transport shall be borne proportionally by the Parties to the conflict
whose nationals are benefited thereby.
Article 76
The censoring of correspondence addressed to prisoners of war or despatched
by them shall be done as quickly as possible. Mail shall be censored only by
the despatching State and the receiving State, and once only by each.
The examination of consignments intended for prisoners of war shall not be
carried out under conditions that will expose the goods contained in them to
deterioration; except in the case of written or printed matter, it shall be done
in the presence of the addressee, or of a fellow-prisoner duly delegated by
him. The delivery to prisoners of individual or collective consignments shall
not be delayed under the pretext of difficulties of censorship.
Any prohibition of correspondence ordered by Parties to the conflict, either
for military or political reasons, shall be only temporary and its duration shall
be as short as possible.
Article 77
The Detaining Power shall provide all facilities for the transmission, through
the Protecting Power or the Central Prisoners of War Agency provided for in
Article 123, of instruments, papers or documents intended for prisoners of
war or despatched by them, especially powers of attorney and wills.
In all cases they shall facilitate the preparation and execution of such documents on behalf of prisoners of war; in particular, they shall allow them to
consult a lawyer and shall take what measures are necessary for the authentication of their signatures.

Relations between prisoners of war and the authorities
CHAPTER I
Complaints of Prisoners of War
Respecting the Conditions of Captivity
Article 78
Prisoners of war shall have the right to make known to the military authorities in whose power they are, their requests regarding the conditions of captivity to which they are subjected.
They shall also have the unrestricted right to apply to the representatives of
the Protecting Powers either through their prisoners’ representative or, if they
consider it necessary, direct, in order to draw their attention to any points on
which they may have complaints to make regarding their conditions of captivity.
Theses requests and complaints shall not be limited nor considered to be
a part of the correspondence quota referred to in Article 71. They must be
transmitted immediately. Even if they are recognized to be unfounded, they
may not give rise to any punishment.
Prisoners’ representative may send periodic reports on the situation in the
camps and the needs of the prisoners of war to the representatives of the
Protecting Powers.
CHAPTER II
Prisoner of War Representatives
Article 79
In all places where there are prisoners of war, except in those where there are
officers, the prisoners shall freely elect by secret ballot, every six months, and
also in case of vacancies, prisoners’ representatives entrusted with representing them before the military authorities, the Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross and any other organization which may
assist them. These prisoners’ representatives shall be eligible for re-election.
In camps for officers and persons of equivalent status or in mixed camps, the
senior officer among the prisoners of war shall be recognized as the camp
prisoners’ representative. In camps for officers, he shall be assisted by one or
more advisers chosen by the officers; in mixed camps, his assistants shall be
chosen from among the prisoners of war who are not officers and shall be
elected by them.
Election
112 THIRD CONVENTION
Officer prisoners of war of the same nationality shall be stationed in labour
camps for prisoners of war, for the purpose of carrying out the camp administration duties for which the prisoners of war are responsible. These officers
may be elected as prisoners’ representatives under the first paragraph of this
Article. In such a case the assistants to the prisoners’ representatives shall be
chosen from among those prisoners of war who are not officers.
Every representative elected must be approved by the Detaining Power before
he has the right to commence his duties. Where the Detaining Power refuses
to approve a prisoner of war elected by his fellow prisoners of war, it must
inform the Protecting Power of the reason for such refusal.
In all cases the prisoners’ representative must have the same nationality, language and customs as the prisoners of war whom he represents. Thus, prisoners of war distributed in different sections of a camp, according to their
nationality, language or customs, shall have for each section their own prisoners’ representative, in accordance with the foregoing paragraphs.
Article 80
Prisoners’ representatives shall further the physical, spiritual and intellectual
well-being of prisoners of war.
In particular, where the prisoners decide to organize amongst themselves a
system of mutual assistance, this organization will be within the province of
the prisoners’ representative, in addition to the special duties entrusted to
him by other provisions of the present Convention.
Prisoners’ representatives shall not be held responsible, simply by reason of
their duties, for any offences committed by prisoners of war.
Article 81
Prisoners’ representatives shall not be required to perform any other work, if
the accomplishment of their duties is thereby made more difficult.
Prisoners’ representatives may appoint from amongst the prisoners such assistants as they may require. All material facilities shall be granted them, particularly a certain freedom of movement necessary for the accomplishment
of their duties (inspection of labour detachments, receipt of supplies, etc.).
Prisoners’ representatives shall be permitted to visit premises where prisoners
of war are detained, and every prisoner of war shall have the right to consult
freely his prisoners’ representative.
All facilities shall likewise be accorded to the prisoners’ representatives for
communication by post and telegraph with the detaining authorities, the
Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross and their
delegates, the Mixed Medical Commissions and with the bodies which give asPrerogatives

sistance to prisoners of war. Prisoners’ representatives of labour detachments
shall enjoy the same facilities for communication with the prisoners’ representatives of the principal camp. Such communications shall not be restricted,
nor considered as forming a part of the quota mentioned in Article 71.
Prisoners’ representatives who are transferred shall be allowed a reasonable
time to acquaint their successors with current affairs.
In case of dismissal, the reasons therefor shall be communicated to the
Protecting Power.
CHAPTER III
Penal and Disciplinary Sanctions
I. General Provisions
Article 82
A prisoner of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations and orders in force
in the armed forces of the Detaining Power; the Detaining Power shall be
justified in taking judicial or disciplinary measures in respect of any offence
committed by a prisoner of war against such laws, regulations or orders.
However, no proceedings or punishments contrary to the provisions of this
Chapter shall be allowed.
If any law, regulation or order of the Detaining Power shall declare acts committed by a prisoner of war to be punishable, whereas the same acts would
not be punishable if committed by a member of the forces of the Detaining
Power, such acts shall entail disciplinary punishments only.
Article 83
In deciding whether proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been
committed by a prisoner of war shall be judicial or disciplinary, the Detaining
Power shall ensure that the competent authorities exercise the greatest leniency and adopt, wherever possible, disciplinary rather than judicial measures.
Article 84
A prisoner of war shall be tried only by a military court, unless the existing
laws of the Detaining Power expressly permit the civil courts to try a member
of the armed forces of the Detaining Power in respect of the particular offence
alleged to have been committed by the prisoner of war.
In no circumstances whatever shall a prisoner of war be tried by a court of any
kind which does not offer the essential guarantees of independence and impartiality as generally recognized, and, in particular, the procedure of which
Choice of
disciplinary
or judicial
proceedings

114 THIRD CONVENTION
does not afford the accused the rights and means of defence provided for in
Article 105.
Article 85
Prisoners of war prosecuted under the laws of the Detaining Power for acts
committed prior to capture shall retain, even if convicted, the benefits of the
present Convention.
Article 86
No prisoner of war may be punished more than once for the same act, or on
the same charge.
Article 87
Prisoners of war may not be sentenced by the military authorities and courts
of the Detaining Power to any penalties except those provided for in respect
of members of the armed forces of the said Power who have committed the
same acts.
When fixing the penalty, the courts or authorities of the Detaining Power shall
take into consideration, to the widest extent possible, the fact that the accused,
not being a national of the Detaining Power, is not bound to it by any duty of
allegiance, and that he is in its power as the result of circumstances independent of his own will. The said courts or authorities shall be at liberty to reduce
the penalty provided for the violation of which the prisoner of war is accused,
and shall therefore not be bound to apply the minimum penalty prescribed.
Collective punishment for individual acts, corporal punishment, imprisonment in premises without daylight and, in general, any form of torture or
cruelty, are forbidden.
No prisoner of war may be deprived of his rank by the Detaining Power, or
prevented from wearing his badges.
Article 88
Officers, non-commissioned officers and men who are prisoners of war undergoing a disciplinary or judicial punishment, shall not be subjected to
more severe treatment than that applied in respect of the same punishment
to members of the armed forces of the Detaining Power of equivalent rank.
A woman prisoner of war shall not be awarded or sentenced to a punishment
more severe, or treated whilst undergoing punishment more severely, than a
woman member of the armed forces of the Detaining Power dealt with for a
similar offence.
In no case may a woman prisoner of war be awarded or sentenced to a punishment more severe, or treated whilst undergoing punishment more severely,

Prisoners of war who have served disciplinary or judicial sentences may not
be treated differently from other prisoners of war.
II. Disciplinary Sanctions
Article 89
The disciplinary punishments applicable to prisoners of war are the following:
1) A fine which shall not exceed 50 per cent of the advances of pay and
working pay which the prisoner of war would otherwise receive under
the provisions of Articles 60 and 62 during a period of not more than
thirty days.
2) Discontinuance of privileges granted over and above the treatment provided for by the present Convention.
3) Fatigue duties not exceeding two hours daily.
4) Confinement.
The punishment referred to under 3) shall not be applied to officers.
In no case shall disciplinary punishments be inhuman, brutal or dangerous to
the health of prisoners of war.
Article 90
The duration of any single punishment shall in no case exceed thirty days.
Any period of confinement awaiting the hearing of a disciplinary offence or
the award of disciplinary punishment shall be deducted from an award pronounced against a prisoner of war.
The maximum of thirty days provided above may not be exceeded, even if
the prisoner of war is answerable for several acts at the same time when he is
awarded punishment, whether such acts are related or not.
The period between the pronouncing of an award of disciplinary punishment
and its execution shall not exceed one month.
When a prisoner of war is awarded a further disciplinary punishment, a period of at least three days shall elapse between the execution of any two of the
punishments, if the duration of one of these is ten days or more.
Article 91
The escape of a prisoner of war shall be deemed to have succeeded when:
1) he has joined the armed forces of the Power on which he depends, or
those of an allied Power;
Escapes
I. Successful
escape
116 THIRD CONVENTION
2) he has left the territory under the control of the Detaining Power, or of
an ally of the said Power;
3) he has joined a ship flying the flag of the Power on which he depends, or
of an allied Power, in the territorial waters of the Detaining Power, the
said ship not being under the control of the last named Power.
Prisoners of war who have made good their escape in the sense of this Article
and who are recaptured, shall not be liable to any punishment in respect of
their previous escape.
Article 92
A prisoner of war who attempts to escape and is recaptured before having
made good his escape in the sense of Article 91 shall be liable only to a disciplinary punishment in respect of this act, even if it is a repeated offence.
A prisoner of war who is recaptured shall be handed over without delay to the
competent military authority.
Article 88, fourth paragraph, notwithstanding, prisoners of war punished as
a result of an unsuccessful escape may be subjected to special surveillance.
Such surveillance must not affect the state of their health, must be undergone
in a prisoner of war camp, and must not entail the suppression of any of the
safeguards granted them by the present Convention.
Article 93
Escape or attempt to escape, even if it is a repeated offence, shall not be
deemed an aggravating circumstance if the prisoner of war is subjected to
trial by judicial proceedings in respect of an offence committed during his
escape or attempt to escape.
In conformity with the principle stated in Article 83, offences committed by
prisoners of war with the sole intention of facilitating their escape and which
do not entail any violence against life or limb, such as offences against public
property, theft without intention of self-enrichment, the drawing up or use
of false papers, the wearing of civilian clothing, shall occasion disciplinary
punishment only.
Prisoners of war who aid or abet an escape or an attempt to escape shall be
liable on this count to disciplinary punishment only.
Article 94
If an escaped prisoner of war is recaptured, the Power on which he depends
shall be notified thereof in the manner defined in Article 122, provided notification of his escape has been made.

Article 95
A prisoner of war accused of an offence against discipline shall not be kept in
confinement pending the hearing unless a member of the armed forces of the
Detaining Power would be so kept if he were accused of a similar offence, or
if it is essential in the interests of camp order and discipline.
Any period spent by a prisoner of war in confinement awaiting the disposal
of an offence against discipline shall be reduced to an absolute minimum and
shall not exceed fourteen days.
The provisions of Articles 97 and 98 of this Chapter shall apply to prisoners of
war who are in confinement awaiting the disposal of offences against discipline.
Article 96
Acts which constitute offences against discipline shall be investigated immediately.
Without prejudice to the competence of courts and superior military authorities, disciplinary punishment may be ordered only by an officer having disciplinary powers in his capacity as camp commander, or by a responsible officer
who replaces him or to whom he has delegated his disciplinary powers.
In no case may such powers be delegated to a prisoner of war or be exercised
by a prisoner of war.
Before any disciplinary award is pronounced, the accused shall be given precise information regarding the offences of which he is accused, and given an
opportunity of explaining his conduct and of defending himself. He shall be
permitted, in particular, to call witnesses and to have recourse, if necessary, to
the services of a qualified interpreter. The decision shall be announced to the
accused prisoner of war and to the prisoners’ representative.
A record of disciplinary punishments shall be maintained by the camp commander and shall be open to inspection by representatives of the Protecting
Power.
Article 97
Prisoners of war shall not in any case be transferred to penitentiary establishments (prisons, penitentiaries, convict prisons, etc.) to undergo disciplinary
punishment therein.
All premises in which disciplinary punishments are undergone shall conform
to the sanitary requirements set forth in Article 25. A prisoner of war undergoing punishment shall be enabled to keep himself in a state of cleanliness, in
conformity with Article 29.
Officers and persons of equivalent status shall not be lodged in the same
quarters as non-commissioned officers or men.
Execution of

I. Premises
118 THIRD CONVENTION
Women prisoners of war undergoing disciplinary punishment shall be confined in separate quarters from male prisoners of war and shall be under the

Article 98
A prisoner of war undergoing confinement as a disciplinary punishment,
shall continue to enjoy the benefits of the provisions of this Convention except in so far as these are necessarily rendered inapplicable by the mere fact
that he is confined. In no case may he be deprived of the benefits of the provisions of Articles 78 and 126.
A prisoner of war awarded disciplinary punishment may not be deprived of
the prerogatives attached to his rank.
Prisoners of war awarded disciplinary punishment shall be allowed to exercise and to stay in the open air at least two hours daily.
They shall be allowed, on their request, to be present at the daily medical inspections. They shall receive the attention which their state of health requires
and, if necessary, shall be removed to the camp infirmary or to a hospital.
They shall have permission to read and write, likewise to send and receive letters. Parcels and remittances of money, however, may be withheld from them
until the completion of the punishment; they shall meanwhile be entrusted to
the prisoners’ representative, who will hand over to the infirmary the perishable goods contained in such parcels.
III. Judicial Proceedings
Article 99
No prisoner of war may be tried or sentenced for an act which is not forbidden by the law of the Detaining Power or by international law, in force at the
time the said act was committed.
No moral or physical coercion may be exerted on a prisoner of war in order to
induce him to admit himself guilty of the act of which he is accused.
No prisoner of war may be convicted without having had an opportunity to
present his defence and the assistance of a qualified advocate or counsel.

The death sentence cannot be pronounced on a prisoner of war unless the
attention of the court has, in accordance with Article 87, second paragraph,
been particularly called to the fact that since the accused is not a national of
the Detaining Power, he is not bound to it by any duty of allegiance, and that
he is in its power as the result of circumstances independent of his own will.
Article 101
If the death penalty is pronounced on a prisoner of war, the sentence shall not
be executed before the expiration of a period of at least six months from the
date when the Protecting Power receives, at an indicated address, the detailed
communication provided for in Article 107.
Article 102
A prisoner of war can be validly sentenced only if the sentence has been pronounced by the same courts according to the same procedure as in the case
of members of the armed forces of the Detaining Power, and if, furthermore,
the provisions of the present Chapter have been observed.
Article 103
Judicial investigations relating to a prisoner of war shall be conducted as rapidly
as circumstances permit and so that his trial shall take place as soon as possible.
A prisoner of war shall not be confined while awaiting trial unless a member of
the armed forces of the Detaining Power would be so confined if he were accused of a similar offence, or if it is essential to do so in the interests of national
security. In no circumstances shall this confinement exceed three months.
Any period spent by a prisoner of war in confinement awaiting trial shall be
deducted from any sentence of imprisonment passed upon him and taken
into account in fixing any penalty.
The provisions of Articles 97 and 98 of this Chapter shall apply to a prisoner
of war whilst in confinement awaiting trial.
Article 104
In any case in which the Detaining Power has decided to institute judicial
proceedings against a prisoner of war, it shall notify the Protecting Power as
soon as possible and at least three weeks before the opening of the trial. This
period of three weeks shall run as from the day on which such notification
reaches the Protecting Power at the address previously indicated by the latter
to the Detaining Power.
III.
Notification
of
proceedings
120 THIRD CONVENTION
The said notification shall contain the following information:
1) surname and first names of the prisoner of war, his rank, his army, regimental, personal or serial number, his date of birth, and his profession
or trade, if any;
2) place of internment or confinement;
3) specification of the charge or charges on which the prisoner of war is to
be arraigned, giving the legal provisions applicable;
4) designation of the court which will try the case, likewise the date and
place fixed for the opening of the trial.
The same communication shall be made by the Detaining Power to the prisoners’ representative.
If no evidence is submitted, at the opening of a trial, that the notification referred to above was received by the Protecting Power, by the prisoner of war
and by the prisoners’ representative concerned, at least three weeks before the
opening of the trial, then the latter cannot take place and must be adjourned.
Article 105
The prisoner of war shall be entitled to assistance by one of his prisoner comrades, to defence by a qualified advocate or counsel of his own choice, to the
calling of witnesses and, if he deems necessary, to the services of a competent
interpreter. He shall be advised of these rights by the Detaining Power in due
time before the trial.
Failing a choice by the prisoner of war, the Protecting Power shall find him
an advocate or counsel, and shall have at least one week at its disposal for the
purpose. The Detaining Power shall deliver to the said Power, on request, a
list of persons qualified to present the defence. Failing a choice of an advocate or counsel by the prisoner of war or the Protecting Power, the Detaining
Power shall appoint a competent advocate or counsel to conduct the defence.
The advocate or counsel conducting the defence on behalf of the prisoner of
war shall have at his disposal a period of two weeks at least before the opening of the trial, as well as the necessary facilities to prepare the defence of the
accused. He may, in particular, freely visit the accused and interview him
in private. He may also confer with any witnesses for the defence, including
prisoners of war. He shall have the benefit of these facilities until the term of
appeal or petition has expired.
Particulars of the charge or charges on which the prisoner of war is to be arraigned, as well as the documents which are generally communicated to the
accused by virtue of the laws in force in the armed forces of the Detaining
Power, shall be communicated to the accused prisoner of war in a language

same communication in the same circumstances shall be made to the advocate or counsel conducting the defence on behalf of the prisoner of war.
The representatives of the Protecting Power shall be entitled to attend the
trial of the case, unless, exceptionally, this is held in camera in the interest of
State security. In such a case the Detaining Power shall advise the Protecting
Power accordingly.
Article 106
Every prisoner of war shall have, in the same manner as the members of the
armed forces of the Detaining Power, the right of appeal or petition from any
sentence pronounced upon him, with a view to the quashing or revising of
the sentence or the reopening of the trial. He shall be fully informed of his
right to appeal or petition and of the time limit within which he may do so.
Article 107
Any judgment and sentence pronounced upon a prisoner of war shall be immediately reported to the Protecting Power in the form of a summary communication, which shall also indicate whether he has the right of appeal with
a view to the quashing of the sentence or the reopening of the trial. This communication shall likewise be sent to the prisoners’ representative concerned.
It shall also be sent to the accused prisoner of war in a language he understands, if the sentence was not pronounced in his presence. The Detaining
Power shall also immediately communicate to the Protecting Power the decision of the prisoner of war to use or to waive his right of appeal.
Furthermore, if a prisoner of war is finally convicted or if a sentence pronounced on a prisoner of war in the first instance is a death sentence, the
Detaining Power shall as soon as possible address to the Protecting Power a
detailed communication containing:
1) the precise wording of the finding and sentence;
2) a summarized report of any preliminary investigation and of the trial,
emphasizing in particular the elements of the prosecution and the defence;
3) notification, where applicable, of the establishment where the sentence
will be served.
The communications provided for in the foregoing sub-paragraphs shall be
sent to the Protecting Power at the address previously made known to the
Detaining Power.
122 THIRD CONVENTION
Article 108
Sentence pronounced on prisoners of war after a conviction has become duly
enforceable shall be served in the same establishments and under the same
conditions as in the case of members of the armed forces of the Detaining
Power. These conditions shall in all cases conform to the requirements of
health and humanity.
A woman prisoner of war on whom such a sentence has been pronounced
shall be confined in separate quarters and shall be under the supervision of
women.
In any case, prisoners of war sentenced to a penalty depriving them of their
liberty shall retain the benefit of the provisions of Articles 78 and 126 of the
present Convention. Furthermore, they shall be entitled to receive and despatch correspondence, to receive at least one relief parcel monthly, to take
regular exercise in the open air, to have the medical care required by their
state of health, and the spiritual assistance they may desire. Penalties to which
they may be subjected shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article 87,

cared for them until they are fit to travel, in accordance with the first paragraph of the following Article.
Throughout the duration of hostilities, Parties to the conflict shall endeavour, with the co-operation of the neutral Powers concerned, to make arrangements for the accommodation in neutral countries of the sick and wounded
prisoners of war referred to in the second paragraph of the following Article.
They may, in addition, conclude agreements with a view to the direct repatriation or internment in a neutral country of able-bodied prisoners of war
who have undergone a long period of captivity.

repatriation
and
accommodation
Article 110
The following shall be repatriated direct;
1) Incurably wounded and sick whose mental or physical fitness seems to
have been gravely diminished.
2) Wounded and sick who, according to medical opinion, are not likely to
recover within one year, whose condition requires treatment and whose
mental or physical fitness seems to have been gravely diminished.
3) Wounded and sick who have recovered, but whose mental or physical
fitness seems to have gravely and permanently diminished.
The following may be accommodated in a neutral country:
1) Wounded and sick whose recovery may be expected within one year
of the date of the wound or the beginning of the illness, if treatment in
a neutral country might increase the prospects of a more certain and
speedy recovery.
2) Prisoners of war whose mental or physical health, according to medical
opinion, is seriously threatened by continued captivity, but whose accommodation in a neutral country might remove such a threat.
The conditions which prisoners of war accommodated in a neutral country
must fulfil in order to permit their repatriation shall be fixed, as shall likewise
their status, by agreement between the Powers concerned. In general, prisoners of war who have been accommodated in a neutral country, and who
belong to the following categories, should be repatriated:
1) those whose state of health has deteriorated so as to fulfil the conditions
laid down for direct repatriation;
2) those whose mental or physical powers remain, even after treatment,
considerably impaired.
If no special agreements are concluded between the Parties to the conflict
concerned, to determine the cases of disablement or sickness entailing direct repatriation or accommodation in a neutral country, such cases shall be
settled in accordance with the principles laid down in the Model Agreement
concerning direct repatriation and accommodation in neutral countries of
wounded and sick prisoners of war and in the Regulations concerning Mixed
Medical Commissions annexed to the present Convention.
Article 111
The Detaining Power, the Power on which the prisoners of war depend, and a
neutral Power agreed upon by these two Powers, shall endeavour to conclude
agreements which will enable prisoners of war to be interned in the territory
of the said neutral Power until the close of hostilities.

124 THIRD CONVENTION
Article 112
Upon the outbreak of hostilities, Mixed Medical Commissions shall be appointed to examine sick and wounded prisoners of war, and to make all appropriate decisions regarding them. The appointment, duties and functioning
of these Commissions shall be in conformity with the provisions of the Regulations annexed to the present Convention.
However, prisoners of war who, in the opinion of the medical authorities of
the Detaining Power, are manifestly seriously injured or seriously sick, may be
repatriated without having to be examined by a Mixed Medical Commission.
Article 113
Besides those who are designated by the medical authorities of the Detaining
Power, wounded or sick prisoners of war belonging to the categories listed
below shall be entitled to present themselves for examination by the Mixed
Medical Commissions provided for in the foregoing Article:
1) Wounded and sick proposed by a physician or surgeon who is of the
same nationality, or a national of a Party to the conflict allied with the
Power on which the said prisoners depend, and who exercises his functions in the camp.
2) Wounded and sick proposed by their prisoners’ representative.
3) Wounded and sick proposed by the Power on which they depend, or by
an organization duly recognized by the said Power and giving assistance
to the prisoners.
Prisoners of war who do not belong to one of the three foregoing categories may nevertheless present themselves for examination by Mixed Medical
Commissions, but shall be examined only after those belonging to the said
categories.
The physician or surgeon of the same nationality as the prisoners who present themselves for examination by the Mixed Medical Commission, likewise
the prisoners’ representative of the said prisoners, shall have permission to be
present at the examination.
Article 114
Prisoners of war who meet with accidents shall, unless the injury is self-inflicted, have the benefit of the provisions of this Convention as regards repatriation or accommodation in a neutral country.

Article 115
No prisoner of war on whom a disciplinary punishment has been imposed
and who is eligible for repatriation or for accommodation in a neutral country, may be kept back on the plea that he has not undergone his punishment.
Prisoners of war detained in connection with a judicial prosecution or conviction and who are designated for repatriation or accommodation in a neutral country, may benefit by such measures before the end of the proceedings
or the completion of the punishment, if the Detaining Power consents.
Parties to the conflict shall communicate to each other the names of those
who will be detained until the end of the proceedings or the completion of
the punishment.
Article 116
The costs of repatriating prisoners of war or of transporting them to a neutral
country shall be borne, from the frontiers of the Detaining Power, by the
Power on which the said prisoners depend.
Article 117
No repatriated person may be employed on active military service.
SECTION II
Release and repatriation of prisoners of war at the close
of hostilities
Article 118
 Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities.
In the absence of stipulations to the above effect in any agreement concluded
between the Parties to the conflict with a view to the cessation of hostilities,
or failing any such agreement, each of the Detaining Powers shall itself establish and execute without delay a plan of repatriation in conformity with the
principle laid down in the foregoing paragraph.
In either case, the measures adopted shall be brought to the knowledge of the
prisoners of war.
The costs of repatriation of prisoners of war shall in all cases be equitably apportioned between the Detaining Power and the Power on which the prisoners depend. This apportionment shall be carried out on the following basis:
a) If the two Powers are contiguous, the Power on which the prisoners
of war depend shall bear the costs of repatriation from the frontiers
of the Detaining Power.

b) If the two Powers are not contiguous, the Detaining Power shall bear
the costs of transport of prisoners of war over its own territory as far
as its frontier or its port of embarkation nearest to the territory of the
Power on which the prisoners of war depend. The Parties concerned
shall agree between themselves as to the equitable apportionment of
the remaining costs of the repatriation. The conclusion of this agreement shall in no circumstances justify any delay in the repatriation
of the prisoners of war.
Article 119
Repatriation shall be effected in conditions similar to those laid down in Articles 46 to 48 inclusive of the present Convention for the transfer of prisoners of war, having regard to the provisions of Article 118 and to those of the
following paragraphs.
On repatriation, any articles of value impounded from prisoners of war under
Article 18, and any foreign currency which has not been converted into the
currency of the Detaining Power, shall be restored to them. Articles of value
and foreign currency which, for any reason whatever, are not restored to prisoners of war on repatriation, shall be despatched to the Information Bureau
set up under Article 122.
Prisoners of war shall be allowed to take with them their personal effects, and
any correspondence and parcels which have arrived for them. The weight of
such baggage may be limited, if the conditions of repatriation so require, to
what each prisoner can reasonably carry. Each prisoner shall in all cases be
authorized to carry at least twenty-five kilograms.
The other personal effects of the repatriated prisoner shall be left in the
charge of the Detaining Power which shall have them forwarded to him as
soon as it has concluded an agreement to this effect, regulating the conditions
of transport and the payment of the costs involved, with the Power on which
the prisoner depends.
Prisoners of war against whom criminal proceedings for an indictable offence are pending may be detained until the end of such proceedings, and, if
necessary, until the completion of the punishment. The same shall apply to
prisoners of war already convicted for an indictable offence.
Parties to the conflict shall communicate to each other the names of any prisoners of war who are detained until the end of the proceedings or until punishment has been completed.
By agreement between the Parties to the conflict, commissions shall be established for the purpose of searching for dispersed prisoners of war and of
assuring their repatriation with the least possible delay.

SECTION III
Death of prisoners of war
Article 120
Wills of prisoners of war shall be drawn up so as to satisfy the conditions of
validity required by the legislation of their country of origin, which will take
steps to inform the Detaining Power of its requirements in this respect. At the
request of the prisoner of war and, in all cases, after death, the will shall be
transmitted without delay to the Protecting Power; a certified copy shall be
sent to the Central Agency.
Death certificates, in the form annexed to the present Convention, or lists
certified by a responsible officer, of all persons who die as prisoners of war
shall be forwarded as rapidly as possible to the Prisoner of War Information
Bureau established in accordance with Article 122. The death certificates or
certified lists shall show particulars of identity as set out in the third paragraph of Article 17, and also the date and place of death, the cause of death,
the date and place of burial and all particulars necessary to identify the graves.
The burial or cremation of a prisoner of war shall be preceded by a medical
examination of the body with a view to confirming death and enabling a report to be made and, where necessary, establishing identity.
The detaining authorities shall ensure that prisoners of war who have died
in captivity are honourably buried, if possible according to the rites of the
religion to which they belonged, and that their graves are respected, suitably
maintained and marked so as to be found at any time. Wherever possible,
deceased prisoners of war who depended on the same Power shall be interred
in the same place.
Deceased prisoners of war shall be buried in individual graves unless unavoidable circumstances require the use of collective graves. Bodies may be
cremated only for imperative reasons of hygiene, on account of the religion
of the deceased or in accordance with his express wish to this effect. In case
of cremation, the fact shall be stated and the reasons given in the death certificate of the deceased.
In order that graves may always be found, all particulars of burials and
graves shall be recorded with a Graves Registration Service established by
the Detaining Power. Lists of graves and particulars of the prisoners of war
interred in cemeteries and elsewhere shall be transmitted to the Power on
which such prisoners of war depended. Responsibility for the care of these
graves and for records of any subsequent moves of the bodies shall rest on the
Power controlling the territory, if a Party to the present Convention. These
provisions shall also apply to the ashes, which shall be kept by the Graves
128 THIRD CONVENTION
Registration Service until proper disposal thereof in accordance with the
wishes of the home country.
Article 121
Every death or serious injury of a prisoner of war caused or suspected to have
been caused by a sentry, another prisoner of war, or any other person, as well
as any death the cause of which is unknown, shall be immediately followed by
an official enquiry by the Detaining Power.
A communication on this subject shall be sent immediately to the Protecting
Power. Statements shall be taken from witnesses, especially from those who
are prisoners of war, and a report including such statements shall be forwarded to the Protecting Power.
If the enquiry indicates the guilt of one or more persons, the Detaining Power
shall take all measures for the prosecution of the person or persons responsible.
PART V
INFORMATION BUREAUX AND RELIEF SOCIETIES FOR
PRISONERS OF WAR
Article 122
Upon the outbreak of a conflict and in all cases of occupation, each of the Parties to the conflict shall institute an official Information Bureau for prisoners
of war who are in its power. Neutral or non-belligerent Powers who may have
received within their territory persons belonging to one of the categories referred to in Article 4, shall take the same action with respect to such persons.
The Power concerned shall ensure that the Prisoners of War Information Bureau is provided with the necessary accommodation, equipment and staff to
ensure its efficient working. It shall be at liberty to employ prisoners of war in
such a Bureau under the conditions laid down in the Section of the present
Convention dealing with work by prisoners of war.
Within the shortest possible period, each of the Parties to the conflict shall
give its Bureau the information referred to in the fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs of this Article regarding any enemy person belonging to one of the
categories referred to in Article 4, who has fallen into its power. Neutral or
non-belligerent Powers shall take the same action with regard to persons belonging to such categories whom they have received within their territory.
The Bureau shall immediately forward such information by the most rapid
means to the Powers concerned, through the intermediary of the Protecting
Powers and likewise of the Central Agency provided for in Article 123.

This information shall make it possible quickly to advise the next of kin concerned. Subject to the provisions of Article 17, the information shall include,
in so far as available to the Information Bureau, in respect of each prisoner of
war, his surname, first names, rank, army, regimental, personal or serial number, place and full date of birth, indication of the Power on which he depends,
first name of the father and maiden name of the mother, name and address of
the person to be informed and the address to which correspondence for the
prisoner may be sent.
The Information Bureau shall receive from the various departments concerned information regarding transfers, releases, repatriations, escapes, admissions to hospital, and deaths, and shall transmit such information in the
manner described in the third paragraph above.
Likewise, information regarding the state of health of prisoners of war who
are seriously ill or seriously wounded shall be supplied regularly, every week
if possible.
The Information Bureau shall also be responsible for replying to all enquiries
sent to it concerning prisoners of war, including those who have died in captivity; it will make any enquiries necessary to obtain the information which is
asked for if this is not in its possession.
All written communications made by the Bureau shall be authenticated by a
signature or a seal.
The Information Bureau shall furthermore be charged with collecting all personal valuables, including sums in currencies other than that of the Detaining
Power and documents of importance to the next of kin, left by prisoners of
war who have been repatriated or released, or who have escaped or died, and
shall forward the said valuables to the Powers concerned. Such articles shall
be sent by the Bureau in sealed packets which shall be accompanied by statements giving clear and full particulars of the identity of the person to whom
the articles belonged, and by a complete list of the contents of the parcel.
Other personal effects of such prisoners of war shall be transmitted under arrangements agreed upon between the Parties to the conflict concerned.
Article 123
A Central Prisoners of War Information Agency shall be created in a neutral
country. The International Committee of the Red Cross shall, if it deems necessary, propose to the Powers concerned the organization of such an Agency.
The function of the Agency shall be to collect all the information it may obtain through official or private channels respecting prisoners of war, and to
transmit it as rapidly as possible to the country of origin of the prisoners of
war or to the Power on which they depend. It shall receive from the Parties to
the conflict all facilities for effecting such transmissions.
Central

130 THIRD CONVENTION
The High Contracting Parties, and in particular those whose nationals benefit
by the services of the Central Agency, are requested to give the said Agency
the financial aid it may require.
The foregoing provisions shall in no way be interpreted as restricting the humanitarian activities of the International Committee of the Red Cross, or of
the relief Societies provided for in Article 125.
Article 124
The national Information Bureaux and the Central Information Agency shall
enjoy free postage for mail, likewise all the exemptions provided for in Article
74, and further, so far as possible, exemption from telegraphic charges or, at
least, greatly reduced rates.
Article 125
Subject to the measures which the Detaining Powers may consider essential
to ensure their security or to meet any other reasonable need, the representatives of religious organizations, relief societies, or any other organization assisting prisoners of war, shall receive from the said Powers, for themselves
and their duly accredited agents, all necessary facilities for visiting the prisoners, distributing relief supplies and material, from any source, intended for
religious, educational or recreative purposes, and for assisting them in organizing their leisure time within the camps. Such societies or organizations may
be constituted in the territory of the Detaining Power or in any other country,
or they may have an international character.
The Detaining Power may limit the number of societies and organizations
whose delegates are allowed to carry out their activities in its territory and
under its supervision, on condition, however, that such limitation shall not
hinder the effective operation of adequate relief to all prisoners of war.
The special position of the International Committee of the Red Cross in this
field shall be recognized and respected at all times.
As soon as relief supplies or material intended for the above-mentioned purposes are handed over to prisoners of war, or very shortly afterwards, receipts
for each consignment, signed by the prisoners’ representative, shall be forwarded to the relief society or organization making the shipment. At the same
time, receipts for these consignments shall be supplied by the administrative
authorities responsible for guarding the prisoners.

ANNEX I
MODEL AGREEMENT CONCERNIN G DIRECT
REPATRIATION AND ACCO MMODATION IN NEUTRAL
COUNTRIES OF WOUNDED AND SICK PRISONERS OF WAR
(see Article 110)
I. Principles for Direct Repatriation
 and Accommodation in Neutral Countries
A. Direct Repatriation
The following shall be repatriated direct:
1) All prisoners of war suffering from the following disabilities as the result of trauma: loss
of limb, paralysis, articular or other disabilities, when this disability is at least the loss of
a hand or a foot, or the equivalent of the loss of a hand or a foot.
Without prejudice to a more generous interpretation, the following shall be considered
as equivalent to the loss of a hand or a foot:
a) Loss of a hand or of all the fingers, or of the thumb and forefinger of one hand; loss
of a foot, or of all the toes and metatarsals of one foot.
b) Ankylosis, loss of osseous tissue, cicatricial contracture preventing the functioning of
one of the large articulations or of all the digital joints of one hand.
c) Pseudarthrosis of the long bones.
d) Deformities due to fracture or other injury which seriously interfere with function
and weight-bearing power.
2) All wounded prisoners of war whose condition has become chronic, to the extent that
prognosis appears to exclude recovery–in spite of treatment–within one year from the
date of the injury, as, for example, in case of:
a) Projectile in the heart, even if the Mixed Medical Commission should fail, at the time
of their examination, to detect any serious disorders.
b) Metallic splinter in the brain or the lungs, even if the Mixed Medical Commission
cannot, at the time of examination, detect any local or general reaction.
c) Osteomyelitis, when recovery cannot be foreseen in the course of the year following
the injury, and which seems likely to result in ankylosis of a joint, or other impairments equivalent to the loss of a hand or a foot.
d) Perforating and suppurating injury to the large joints.
e) Injury to the skull, with loss or shifting of bony tissue.
f) Injury or burning of the face with loss of tissue and functional lesions.
g) Injury to the spinal cord.
h) Lesion of the peripheral nerves, the sequelae of which are equivalent to the loss of a
hand or foot, and the cure of which requires more than a year from the date of in-
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 137
jury, for example: injury to the brachial or lumbosacral plexus, the median or sciatic
nerves, likewise combined injury to the radial and cubital nerves or to the lateral
popliteal nerve (N. peroneus communis) and medial popliteal nerve (N. tibialis); etc.
The separate injury of the radial (musculo-spiral), cubital, lateral or medial popliteal
nerves shall not, however, warrant repatriation except in case of contractures or of
serious neurotrophic disturbance.
3) All sick prisoners of war whose condition has become chronic to the extent that prognosis seems to exclude recovery–in spite of treatment–within one year from the inception
of the disease, as, for example, in case of:
a) Progressive tuberculosis of any organ which, according to medical prognosis, cannot
be cured, or at least considerably improved by treatment in a neutral country.
b) Exudate pleurisy.
c) Serious diseases of the respiratory organs of non-tubercular etiology, presumed incurable, for example: serious pulmonary emphysema, with or without bronchitis;
chronic asthma;* chronic bronchitis* lasting more than one year in captivity; bronchiectasis;* etc.
d) Serious chronic affections of the circulatory system, for example: valvular lesions and
myocarditis,* which have shown signs of circulatory failure during captivity, even
though the Mixed Medical Commission cannot detect any such signs at the time of
examination; affections of the pericardium and the vessels (Buerger’s disease, aneurism of the large vessels); etc.
e) Serious chronic affections of the digestive organs, for example: gastric or duodenal
ulcer; sequelae of gastric operations performed in captivity; chronic gastritis enteritis

II. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS
1) The conditions given shall, in a general way, be interpreted and applied in as broad a
spirit as possible.
Neuropathic and psychopathic conditions caused by war or captivity, as well as cases of
tuberculosis in all stages, shall above all benefit by such liberal interpretation. Prisoners
of war who have sustained several wounds, none of which, considered by itself, justifies
repatriation, shall be examined in the same spirit, with due regard for the psychic traumatism due to the number of their wounds.
2) All unquestionable cases giving the right to direct repatriation (amputation, total blindness or deafness, open pulmonary tuberculosis, mental disorder, malignant growth, etc.)
shall be examined and repatriated as soon as possible by the camp physicians or by military medical commissions appointed by the Detaining Power.
3) Injuries and diseases which existed before the war and which have not become worse,
as well as war injuries which have not prevented subsequent military service, shall not
entitle to direct repatriation.
4) The provisions of this Annex shall be interpreted and applied in a similar manner in all
countries party to the conflict. The Powers and authorities concerned shall grant to Mixed
Medical Commissions all the facilities necessary for the accomplishment of their task.
5) The examples quoted under (I) above represent only typical cases. Cases which do not correspond exactly to these provisions shall be judged in the spirit of the provisions of Article
110 of the present Convention, and of the principles embodied in the present Agreement.

Article 11
The decisions made by the Mixed Medical Commissions in each specific case shall be communicated, during the month following their visit, to the Detaining Power, the Protecting
Power and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Mixed Medical Commissions

Article 13
If there is no neutral physician in a country where the services of a Mixed Medical Commission

Commission, subject to the provisions of Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 of the present Regulations.
Article 14

142 THIRD CONVENTION
ANNEX III
REGULATIONS CONCERNIN G COLLECTIVE RELIEF
(see Article 73)
Article 1
Prisoners’ representatives shall be allowed to distribute collective relief shipments for which
they are responsible, to all prisoners of war administered by their camp, including those who
are in hospitals, or in prisons or other penal establishments.
Article 2
The distribution of collective relief shipments shall be effected in accordance with the instructions of the donors and with a plan drawn up by the prisoners’ representatives. The issue of
medical stores shall, however, be made for preference in agreement with the senior medical
officers, and the latter may, in hospitals and infirmaries, waive the said instructions, if the
needs of their patients so demand. Within the limits thus defined, the distribution shall always be carried out equitably.
Article 3
The said prisoners’ representatives or their assistants shall be allowed to go to the points of
arrival of relief supplies near their camps, so as to enable the prisoners’ representatives or their
assistants to verify the quality as well as the quantity of the goods received, and to make out
detailed reports thereon for the donors.
Article 4
Prisoners’ representatives shall be given the facilities necessary for verifying whether the distribution of collective relief in all sub-divisions and annexes of their camps has been carried
out in accordance with their instructions.
Article 5
Prisoners’ representatives shall be allowed to fill up, and cause to be filled up by the prisoners’ representatives of labour detachments or by the senior medical officers of infirmaries and
hospitals, forms or questionnaires intended for the donors, relating to collective relief supplies
(distribution, requirements, quantities, etc.). Such forms and questionnaires, duly completed,
shall be forwarded to the donors without delay.
Article 6
In order to secure the regular issue of collective relief to the prisoners of war in their camp,
and to meet any needs that may arise from the arrival of new contingents of prisoners, prisoners’ representatives shall be allowed to build up and maintain adequate reserve stocks of
collective relief. For this purpose, they shall have suitable warehouses at their disposal; each
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 143
warehouse shall be provided with two locks, the prisoners’ representative holding the keys of
one lock and the camp commander the keys of the other.
Article 7
When collective consignments of clothing are available, each prisoner of war shall retain in
his possession at least one complete set of clothes. If a prisoner has more than one set of
clothes, the prisoners’ representative shall be permitted to withdraw excess clothing from
those with the largest number of sets, or particular articles in excess of one, if this is necessary in order to supply prisoners who are less well provided. He shall not, however, withdraw
second sets of underclothing, socks or footwear, unless this is the only means of providing for
prisoners of war with none.
Article 8
The High Contracting Parties, and the Detaining Powers in particular, shall authorize, as far
as possible and subject to the regulations governing the supply of the population, all purchases of goods made in their territories for the distribution of collective relief to prisoners of war.
They shall similarly facilitate the transfer of funds and other financial measures of a technical
or administrative nature taken for the purpose of making such purchases.
Article 9
The foregoing provisions shall not constitute an obstacle to the right of prisoners of war to
receive collective relief before their arrival in a camp or in the course of transfer, nor to the
possibility of representatives of the Protecting Power, the International Committee of the Red
Cross, or any other body giving assistance to prisoners which may be responsible for the
forwarding of such supplies, ensuring the distribution thereof to the addressees by any other
means that they may deem useful.

PART I
General Provisions
Article 1
The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for
the present Convention in all circumstances.
Article 2
In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the
present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other
armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them.
The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of
the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets
with no armed resistance.
Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present
Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in
their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention
in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions
thereof.
Article 3
In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in
the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict
shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions:
1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of
armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de
combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all
circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction

RELATIVE TO THE PROTECTION OF CIVILIAN PERSONS
IN TIME OF WAR OF 12 AU GUST 1949
The undersigned Plenipotentiaries of the Governments represented at the Diplomatic
Conference held at Geneva from April 21 to August 12, 1949, for the purpose of establishing
a Convention for the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, have agreed as follows:

founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any
other similar criteria.
To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time
and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons:
a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;
b) taking of hostages;
c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment;
d) the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without
previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.
2) The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for.
An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee
of the Red Cross, may offer its services to the Parties to the conflict.
The Parties to the conflict should further endeavour to bring into force,
by means of special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the
present Convention.
The application of the preceding provisions shall not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict.
Article 4
Persons protected by the Convention are those who at a given moment and in
any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation,
in the hands of persons a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which
they are not nationals.
Nationals of a State which is not bound by the Convention are not protected
by it. Nationals of a neutral State who find themselves in the territory of a
belligerent State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, shall not be regarded
as protected persons while the State of which they are nationals has normal
diplomatic representation in the State in whose hands they are.
The provisions of Part II are, however, wider in application, as defined in
Article 13.
Persons protected by the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the
Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August
12, 1949, or by the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition
of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea of
August 12, 1949, or by the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of

persons
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 153
Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949, shall not be considered as protected
persons within the meaning of the present Convention.
Article 5
Where, in the territory of a Party to the conflict, the latter is satisfied that an
individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities
hostile to the security of the State, such individual person shall not be entitled
to claim such rights and privileges under the present Convention as would, if
exercised in the favour of such individual person, be prejudicial to the security of such State.
Where in occupied territory an individual protected person is detained as a
spy or saboteur, or as a person under definite suspicion of activity hostile to
the security of the Occupying Power, such person shall, in those cases where
absolute military security so requires, be regarded as having forfeited rights
of communication under the present Convention.
In each case, such persons shall nevertheless be treated with humanity, and in
case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed
by the present Convention. They shall also be granted the full rights and privileges of a protected person under the present Convention at the earliest date
consistent with the security of the State or Occupying Power, as the case may be.
Article 6
The present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.
In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present
Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.
In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention
shall cease one year after the general close of military operations; however,
the Occupying Power shall be bound, for the duration of the occupation, to
the extent that such Power exercises the functions of government in such territory, by the provisions of the following Articles of the present Convention:
1 to 12, 27, 29 to 34, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 59, 61 to 77, 143.
Protected persons whose release, repatriation or re-establishment may take place
after such dates shall meanwhile continue to benefit by the present Convention.
Article 7
In addition to the agreements expressly provided for in Articles 11, 14, 15, 17,
36, 108, 109, 132, 133 and 149, the High Contracting Parties may conclude
other special agreements for all matters concerning which they may deem it
suitable to make separate provision. No special agreement shall adversely afDerogations

fect the situation of protected persons, as defined by the present Convention,
nor restrict the rights which it confers upon them.
Protected persons shall continue to have the benefit of such agreements as
long as the Convention is applicable to them, except where express provisions
to the contrary are contained in the aforesaid or in subsequent agreements, or
where more favourable measures have been taken with regard to them by one
or other of the Parties to the conflict.
Article 8
Protected persons may in no circumstances renounce in part or in entirety
the rights secured to them by the present Convention, and by the special
agreements referred to in the foregoing Article, if such there be.
Article 9
The present Convention shall be applied with the co-operation and under the
scrutiny of the Protecting Powers whose duty it is to safeguard the interests
of the Parties to the conflict. For this purpose, the Protecting Powers may appoint, apart from their diplomatic or consular staff, delegates from amongst
their own nationals or the nationals of other neutral Powers. The said delegates shall be subject to the approval of the Power with which they are to
carry out their duties.
The Parties to the conflict shall facilitate to the greatest extent possible the
task of the representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers.
The representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers shall not in any case
exceed their mission under the present Convention. They shall, in particular,
take account of the imperative necessities of security of the State wherein they
carry out their duties.
Article 10
The provisions of the present Convention constitute no obstacle to the humanitarian activities which the International Committee of the Red Cross or
any other impartial humanitarian organization may, subject to the consent of
the Parties to the conflict concerned, undertake for the protection of civilian
persons and for their relief.
Article 11
The High Contracting Parties may at any time agree to entrust to an international organization which offers all guarantees of impartiality and efficacy the
duties incumbent on the Protecting Powers by virtue of the present Convention.

Power shall request a neutral State, or such an organization, to undertake the
functions performed under the present Convention by a Protecting Power
designated by the Parties to a conflict.
If protection cannot be arranged accordingly, the Detaining Power shall request or shall accept, subject to the provisions of this Article, the offer of the
services of a humanitarian organization, such as the International Committee
of the Red Cross, to assume the humanitarian functions performed by
Protecting Powers under the present Convention.
Any neutral Power or any organization invited by the Power concerned or
offering itself for these purposes, shall be required to act with a sense of responsibility towards the Party to the conflict on which persons protected by
the present Convention depend, and shall be required to furnish sufficient
assurances that it is in a position to undertake the appropriate functions and
to discharge them impartially.
No derogation from the preceding provisions shall be made by special agreements between Powers one of which is restricted, even temporarily, in its
freedom to negotiate with the other Power or its allies by reason of military
events, more particularly where the whole, or a substantial part, of the territory of the said Power is occupied.
Whenever in the present Convention mention is made of a Protecting Power,
such mention applies to substitute organizations in the sense of the present
Article.
The provisions of this Article shall extend and be adapted to cases of nationals
of a neutral State who are in occupied territory or who find themselves in the
territory of a belligerent State in which the State of which they are nationals
has not normal diplomatic representation.
Article 12
In cases where they deem it advisable in the interest of protected persons,
particularly in cases of disagreement between the Parties to the conflict as to
the application or interpretation of the provisions of the present Convention,
the Protecting Powers shall lend their good offices with a view to settling the
disagreement.
For this purpose, each of the Protecting Powers may, either at the invitation
of one Party or on its own initiative, propose to the Parties to the conflict a
meeting of their representatives, and in particular of the authorities responsible for protected persons, possibly on neutral territory suitably chosen. The
Parties to the conflict shall be bound to give effect to the proposals made to
them for this purpose. The Protecting Powers may, if necessary, propose for
approval by the Parties to the conflict, a person belonging to a neutral Power

PART II
GENERAL PROTECTION OF POPULATIONS
AGAINST CERTAIN CONSE QUENCES OF WAR
Article 13
The provisions of Part II cover the whole of the populations of the countries
in conflict, without any adverse distinction based, in particular, on race, nationality, religion or political opinion, and are intended to alleviate the sufferings caused by war.
Article 14
In time of peace, the High Contracting Parties and, after the outbreak of hostilities, the Parties thereto, may establish in their own territory and, if the need
arises, in occupied areas, hospital and safety zones and localities so organized
as to protect from the effects of war, wounded, sick and aged persons, children under fifteen, expectant mothers and mothers of children under seven.
Upon the outbreak and during the course of hostilities, the Parties concerned
may conclude agreements on mutual recognition of the zones and localities
they have created. They may for this purpose implement the provisions of the
Draft Agreement annexed to the present Convention, with such amendments
as they may consider necessary.
The Protecting Powers and the International Committee of the Red Cross
are invited to lend their good offices in order to facilitate the institution and
recognition of these hospital and safety zones and localities.
Article 15
Any Party to the conflict may, either direct or through a neutral State or some
humanitarian organization, propose to the adverse Party to establish, in the
regions where fighting is taking place, neutralized zones intended to shelter
from the effects of war the following persons, without distinction:
a) wounded and sick combatants or non-combatants;
b) civilian persons who take no part in hostilities, and who, while they
reside in the zones, perform no work of a military character.
When the Parties concerned have agreed upon the geographical position, administration, food supply and supervision of the proposed neutralized zone,
a written agreement shall be concluded and signed by the representatives of
the Parties to the conflict. The agreement shall fix the beginning and the duration of the neutralization of the zone.

I. General
protection
Article 16
The wounded and sick, as well as the infirm, and expectant mothers, shall be
the object of particular protection and respect.
As far as military considerations allow, each Party to the conflict shall facilitate the steps taken to search for the killed and wounded, to assist the
shipwrecked and other persons exposed to grave danger, and to protect them
against pillage and ill-treatment.
Article 17
The Parties to the conflict shall endeavour to conclude local agreements for the
removal from besieged or encircled areas, of wounded, sick, infirm, and aged
persons, children and maternity cases, and for the passage of ministers of all religions, medical personnel and medical equipment on their way to such areas.
Article 18
Civilian hospitals organized to give care to the wounded and sick, the infirm
and maternity cases, may in no circumstances be the object of attack, but shall
at all times be respected and protected by the Parties to the conflict.
States which are Parties to a conflict shall provide all civilian hospitals with
certificates showing that they are civilian hospitals and that the buildings
which they occupy are not used for any purpose which would deprive these
hospitals of protection in accordance with Article 19.
Civilian hospitals shall be marked by means of the emblem provided for in
Article 38 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of
the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949, but
only if so authorized by the State.
The Parties to the conflict shall, in so far as military considerations permit,
take the necessary steps to make the distinctive emblems indicating civilian
hospitals clearly visible to the enemy land, air and naval forces in order to
obviate the possibility of any hostile action.
In view of the dangers to which hospitals may be exposed by being close to
military objectives, it is recommended that such hospitals be situated as far as
possible from such objectives.
Article 19
The protection to which civilian hospitals are entitled shall not cease unless
they are used to commit, outside their humanitarian duties, acts harmful to
the enemy. Protection may, however, cease only after due warning has been
given, naming, in all appropriate cases, a reasonable time limit, and after such
warning has remained unheeded.

158 FOURTH CONVENTION
The fact that sick or wounded members of the armed forces are nursed in
these hospitals, or the presence of small arms and ammunition taken from
such combatants and not yet handed to the proper service, shall not be considered to be acts harmful to the enemy.
Article 20
Persons regularly and solely engaged in the operation and administration of
civilian hospitals, including the personnel engaged in the search for, removal
and transporting of and caring for wounded and sick civilians, the infirm and
maternity cases, shall be respected and protected.
In occupied territory and in zones of military operations, the above personnel shall be recognizable by means of an identity card certifying their status,
bearing the photograph of the holder and embossed with the stamp of the
responsible authority, and also by means of a stamped, water-resistant armlet
which they shall wear on the left arm while carrying out their duties. This
armlet shall be issued by the State and shall bear the emblem provided for in
Article 38 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition
of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949.
Other personnel who are engaged in the operation and administration of civilian hospitals shall be entitled to respect and protection and to wear the
armlet, as provided in and under the conditions prescribed in this Article,
while they are employed on such duties. The identity card shall state the duties on which they are employed.
The management of each hospital shall at all times hold at the disposal of the
competent national or occupying authorities an up-to-date list of such personnel.
Article 21
Convoys of vehicles or hospital trains on land or specially provided vessels on
sea, conveying wounded and sick civilians, the infirm and maternity cases,
shall be respected and protected in the same manner as the hospitals provided for in Article 18, and shall be marked, with the consent of the State, by
the display of the distinctive emblem provided for in Article 38 of the Geneva
Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick
in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949.
Article 22
Aircraft exclusively employed for the removal of wounded and sick civilians,

38 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the
Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949.
Unless agreed otherwise, flights over enemy or enemy-occupied territory are
prohibited.
Such aircraft shall obey every summons to land. In the event of a landing thus
imposed, the aircraft with its occupants may continue its flight after examination, if any.
Article 23
Each High Contracting Party shall allow the free passage of all consignments
of medical and hospital stores and objects necessary for religious worship intended only for civilians of another High Contracting Party, even if the latter
is its adversary. It shall likewise permit the free passage of all consignments of
essential foodstuffs, clothing and tonics intended for children under fifteen,
expectant mothers and maternity cases.
The obligation of a High Contracting Party to allow the free passage of the
consignments indicated in the preceding paragraph is subject to the condition that this Party is satisfied that there are no serious reasons for fearing:
a) that the consignments may be diverted from their destination,
b) that the control may not be effective, or
c) that a definite advantage may accrue to the military efforts or economy
of the enemy through the substitution of the above-mentioned consignments for goods which would otherwise be provided or produced
by the enemy or through the release of such material, services or facilities as would otherwise be required for the production of such goods.
The Power which allows the passage of the consignments indicated in the
first paragraph of this Article may make such permission conditional on the
distribution to the persons benefited thereby being made under the local supervision of the Protecting Powers.
Such consignments shall be forwarded as rapidly as possible, and the Power
which permits their free passage shall have the right to prescribe the technical
arrangements under which such passage is allowed.
Article 24
The Parties to the conflict shall take the necessary measures to ensure that
children under fifteen, who are orphaned or are separated from their families as a result of the war, are not left to their own resources, and that their
maintenance, the exercise of their religion and their education are facilitated
in all circumstances. Their education shall, as far as possible, be entrusted to
persons of a similar cultural tradition.

The Parties to the conflict shall facilitate the reception of such children in a
neutral country for the duration of the conflict with the consent of the Protecting Power, if any, and under due safeguards for the observance of the
principles stated in the first paragraph.
They shall, furthermore, endeavour to arrange for all children under twelve to
be identified by the wearing of identity discs, or by some other means.
Article 25
All persons in the territory of a Party to the conflict, or in a territory occupied
by it, shall be enabled to give news of a strictly personal nature to members
of their families, wherever they may be, and to receive news from them. This
correspondence shall be forwarded speedily and without undue delay.
If, as a result of circumstances, it becomes difficult or impossible to exchange
family correspondence by the ordinary post, the Parties to the conflict concerned shall apply to a neutral intermediary, such as the Central Agency
provided for in Article 140, and shall decide in consultation with it how to
ensure the fulfilment of their obligations under the best possible conditions,
in particular with the co-operation of the National Red Cross (Red Crescent,
Red Lion and Sun) Societies.
If the Parties to the conflict deem it necessary to restrict family correspondence, such restrictions shall be confined to the compulsory use of standard
forms containing twenty-five freely chosen words, and to the limitation of the
number of these forms despatched to one each month.
Article 26
Each Party to the conflict shall facilitate enquiries made by members of families dispersed owing to the war, with the object of renewing contact with one
another and of meeting, if possible. It shall encourage, in particular, the work
of organizations engaged on this task provided they are acceptable to it and
conform to its security regulations.

STATUS AND TREAT MENT OF PROTECTED PERSONS
SECTION I
Provisions common to the territories of the parties
to the conflict and to occupied territories
Article 27
Protected persons are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their honour, their family rights, their religious convictions and practices, and their manners and customs. They shall at all times be humanely
treated, and shall be protected especially against all acts of violence or threats
thereof and against insults and public curiosity.
Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honour, in
particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault.
Without prejudice to the provisions relating to their state of health, age and
sex, all protected persons shall be treated with the same consideration by the
Party to the conflict in whose power they are, without any adverse distinction
based, in particular, on race, religion or political opinion.
However, the Parties to the conflict may take such measures of control and security in regard to protected persons as may be necessary as a result of the war.
Article 28
The presence of a protected person may not be used to render certain points
or areas immune from military operations.
Article 29
The Party to the conflict in whose hands protected persons may be, is responsible for the treatment accorded to them by its agents, irrespective of any
individual responsibility which may be incurred.
Article 30
Protected persons shall have every facility for making application to the Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the National
Red Cross (Red Crescent, Red Lion and Sun) Society of the country where
they may be, as well as to any organization that might assist them.
These several organizations shall be granted all facilities for that purpose by
the authorities, within the bounds set by military or security considerations.
Apart from the visits of the delegates of the Protecting Powers and of the
International Committee of the Red Cross, provided for by Article 143, the
Detaining or Occupying Powers shall facilitate as much as possible visits to

The High Contracting Parties specifically agree that each of them is prohibited from taking any measure of such a character as to cause the physical
suffering or extermination of protected persons in their hands. This prohibition applies not only to murder, torture, corporal punishment, mutilation and
medical or scientific experiments not necessitated by the medical treatment
of a protected person, but also to any other measures of brutality whether applied by civilian or military agents.

during a conflict, shall be entitled to do so, unless their departure is contrary
to the national interests of the State. The applications of such persons to leave
shall be decided in accordance with regularly established procedures and the
decision shall be taken as rapidly as possible. Those persons permitted to leave
may provide themselves with the necessary funds for their journey and take
with them a reasonable amount of their effects and articles of personal use.
If any such person is refused permission to leave the territory, he shall be entitled
to have such refusal reconsidered as soon as possible by an appropriate court or
administrative board designated by the Detaining Power for that purpose.

Method of
repatriation
Upon request, representatives of the Protecting Power shall, unless reasons
of security prevent it, or the persons concerned object, be furnished with the
reasons for refusal of any request for permission to leave the territory and be
given, as expeditiously as possible, the names of all persons who have been
denied permission to leave.
Article 36
Departures permitted under the foregoing Article shall be carried out in satisfactory conditions as regards safety, hygiene, sanitation and food. All costs
in connection therewith, from the point of exit in the territory of the Detaining Power, shall be borne by the country of destination, or, in the case of
accommodation in a neutral country, by the Power whose nationals are benefited. The practical details of such movements may, if necessary, be settled by
special agreements between the Powers concerned.
The foregoing shall not prejudice such special agreements as may be concluded between Parties to the conflict concerning the exchange and repatriation
of their nationals in enemy hands.
Article 37
Protected persons who are confined pending proceedings or serving a sentence
involving loss of liberty, shall during their confinement be humanely treated.
As soon as they are released, they may ask to leave the territory in conformity
with the foregoing Articles.
Article 38
With the exception of special measures authorized by the present Convention,
in particular by Articles 27 and 41 thereof, the situation of protected persons
shall continue to be regulated, in principle, by the provisions concerning aliens in time of peace. In any case, the following rights shall be granted to them:
1) They shall be enabled to receive the individual or collective relief that
may be sent to them.
2) They shall, if their state of health so requires, receive medical attention
and hospital treatment to the same extent as the nationals of the State
concerned.
3) They shall be allowed to practise their religion and to receive spiritual
assistance from ministers of their faith.
4) If they reside in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war, they
shall be authorized to move from that area to the same extent as the nationals of the State concerned.

under seven years shall benefit by any preferential treatment to the same
extent as the nationals of the State concerned.
Article 39
Protected persons who, as a result of the war, have lost their gainful employment, shall be granted the opportunity to find paid employment. That opportunity shall, subject to security considerations and to the provisions of
Article 40, be equal to that enjoyed by the nationals of the Power in whose
territory they are.
Where a Party to the conflict applies to a protected person methods of control
which result in his being unable to support himself, and especially if such a
person is prevented for reasons of security from finding paid employment on
reasonable conditions, the said Party shall ensure his support and that of his
dependents.
Protected persons may in any case receive allowances from their home country, the Protecting Power, or the relief societies referred to in Article 30.
Article 40
Protected persons may be compelled to work only to the same extent as nationals of the Party to the conflict in whose territory they are.
If protected persons are of enemy nationality, they may only be compelled to
do work which is normally necessary to ensure the feeding, sheltering, clothing, transport and health of human beings and which is not directly related to
the conduct of military operations.
In the cases mentioned in the two preceding paragraphs, protected persons
compelled to work shall have the benefit of the same working conditions and
of the same safeguards as national workers, in particular as regards wages,
hours of labour, clothing and equipment, previous training and compensation for occupational accidents and diseases.
If the above provisions are infringed, protected persons shall be allowed to
exercise their right of complaint in accordance with Article 30.
Article 41
Should the Power in whose hands protected persons may be consider the
measures of control mentioned in the present Convention to be inadequate,
it may not have recourse to any other measure of control more severe than
that of assigned residence or internment, in accordance with the provisions
of Articles 42 and 43.

Voluntary
internment
In applying the provisions of Article 39, second paragraph, to the cases of persons required to leave their usual places of residence by virtue of a decision
placing them in assigned residence elsewhere, the Detaining Power shall be
guided as closely as possible by the standards of welfare set forth in Part III,
Section IV of this Convention.
Article 42
The internment or placing in assigned residence of protected persons may be
ordered only if the security of the Detaining Power makes it absolutely necessary.
If any person, acting through the representatives of the Protecting Power, voluntarily demands internment, and if his situation renders this step necessary,
he shall be interned by the Power in whose hands he may be.
Article 43
Any protected person who has been interned or placed in assigned residence
shall be entitled to have such action reconsidered as soon as possible by an
appropriate court or administrative board designated by the Detaining Power
for that purpose. If the internment or placing in assigned residence is maintained, the court or administrative board shall periodically, and at least twice
yearly, give consideration to his or her case, with a view to the favourable
amendment of the initial decision, if circumstances permit.
Unless the protected persons concerned object, the Detaining Power shall,
as rapidly as possible, give the Protecting Power the names of any protected
persons who have been interned or subjected to assigned residence, or who
have been released from internment or assigned residence. The decisions of
the courts or boards mentioned in the first paragraph of the present Article
shall also, subject to the same conditions, be notified as rapidly as possible to
the Protecting Power.
Article 44
In applying the measures of control mentioned in the present Convention,
the Detaining Power shall not treat as enemy aliens exclusively on the basis of
their nationality de jure of an enemy State, refugees who do not, in fact, enjoy
the protection of any government.
Article 45
Protected persons shall not be transferred to a Power which is not a party to
the Convention.
This provision shall in no way constitute an obstacle to the repatriation of
protected persons, or to their return to their country of residence after the
cessation of hostilities.

VI. Procedure
166 FOURTH CONVENTION
Protected persons may be transferred by the Detaining Power only to a Power
which is a party to the present Convention and after the Detaining Power has
satisfied itself of the willingness and ability of such transferee Power to apply the present Convention. If protected persons are transferred under such
circumstances, responsibility for the application of the present Convention
rests on the Power accepting them, while they are in its custody. Nevertheless,
if that Power falls to carry out the provisions of the present Convention in
any important respect, the Power by which the protected persons were transferred shall, upon being so notified by the Protecting Power, take effective
measures to correct the situation or shall request the return of the protected
persons. Such request must be complied with.
In no circumstances shall a protected person be transferred to a country
where he or she may have reason to fear persecution for his or her political
opinions or religious beliefs.
The provisions of this Article do not constitute an obstacle to the extradition,
in pursuance of extradition treaties concluded before the outbreak of hostilities, of protected persons accused of offences against ordinary criminal law.
Article 46
In so far as they have not been previously withdrawn, restrictive measures
taken regarding protected persons shall be cancelled as soon as possible after
the close of hostilities.
Restrictive measures affecting their property shall be cancelled, in accordance
with the law of the Detaining Power, as soon as possible after the close of
hostilities.
SECTION III
Occupied territories
Article 47
Protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any
case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention
by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into
the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement
concluded between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the
occupied territory.

Article 48
Protected persons who are not nationals of the Power whose territory is occupied, may avail themselves of the right to leave the territory subject to the
provisions of Article 35, and decisions thereon shall be taken according to the
procedure which the Occupying Power shall establish in accordance with the
said Article.
Article 49
Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that
of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.
Nevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military
reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of
protected persons outside the bounds of the occupied territory except when
for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus
evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the
area in question have ceased.
The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure,
to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to
receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory
conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the
same family are not separated.
The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as
soon as they have taken place.
The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or
imperative military reasons so demand.
The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian
population into the territory it occupies.
Article 50
The Occupying Power shall, with the co-operation of the national and local
authorities, facilitate the proper working of all institutions devoted to the care
and education of children.
The Occupying Power shall take all necessary steps to facilitate the identification of children and the registration of their parentage. It may not, in any case,
change their personal status, nor enlist them in formations or organizations
subordinate to it.
Children
168 FOURTH CONVENTION
Should the local institutions be inadequate for the purpose, the Occupying
Power shall make arrangements for the maintenance and education, if possible by persons of their own nationality, language and religion, of children
who are orphaned or separated from their parents as a result of the war and
who cannot be adequately cared for by a near relative or friend.
A special section of the Bureau set up in accordance with Article 136 shall be
responsible for taking all necessary steps to identify children whose identity
is in doubt. Particulars of their parents or other near relatives should always
be recorded if available.
The Occupying Power shall not hinder the application of any preferential
measures in regard to food, medical care and protection against the effects of
war, which may have been adopted prior to the occupation in favour of children under fifteen years, expectant mothers, and mothers of children under
seven years.
Article 51
The Occupying Power may not compel protected persons to serve in its
armed or auxiliary forces. No pressure or propaganda which aims at securing
voluntary enlistment is permitted.
The Occupying Power may not compel protected persons to work unless they
are over eighteen years of age, and then only on work which is necessary
either for the needs of the army of occupation, or for the public utility services, or for the feeding, sheltering, clothing, transportation or health of the
population of the occupied country. Protected persons may not be compelled
to undertake any work which would involve them in the obligation of taking
part in military operations. The Occupying Power may not compel protected
persons to employ forcible means to ensure the security of the installations
where they are performing compulsory labour.
The work shall be carried out only in the occupied territory where the persons whose services have been requisitioned are. Every such person shall, so
far as possible, be kept in his usual place of employment. Workers shall be
paid a fair wage and the work shall be proportionate to their physical and intellectual capacities. The legislation in force in the occupied country concerning working conditions, and safeguards as regards, in particular, such matters
as wages, hours of work, equipment, preliminary training and compensation
for occupational accidents and diseases, shall be applicable to the protected
persons assigned to the work referred to in this Article.
In no case shall requisition of labour lead to a mobilization of workers in an
organization of a military or semi-military character.

Article 52
No contract, agreement or regulation shall impair the right of any worker,
whether voluntary or not and wherever he may be, to apply to the representatives of the Protecting Power in order to request the said Power’s intervention.
All measures aiming at creating unemployment or at restricting the opportunities offered to workers in an occupied territory, in order to induce them to
work for the Occupying Power, are prohibited.
Article 53
Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other
public authorities, or to social or co-operative organizations, is prohibited,
except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military
operations.
Article 54
The Occupying Power may not alter the status of public officials or judges in
the occupied territories, or in any way apply sanctions to or take any measures of coercion or discrimination against them, should they abstain from
fulfilling their functions for reasons of conscience.
This prohibition does not prejudice the application of the second paragraph
of Article 51. It does not affect the right of the Occupying Power to remove
public officials from their posts.
Article 55
To the fullest extent of the means available to it, the Occupying Power has the

particular, bring in the necessary foodstuffs, medical stores and other articles
if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate.
The Occupying Power may not requisition foodstuffs, articles or medical
supplies available in the occupied territory, except for use by the occupation
forces and administration personnel, and then only if the requirements of the
civilian population have been taken into account. Subject to the provisions of
other international Conventions, the Occupying Power shall make arrangements to ensure that fair value is paid for any requisitioned goods.
The Protecting Power shall, at any time, be at liberty to verify the state of the
food and medical supplies in occupied territories, except where temporary
restrictions are made necessary by imperative military requirements.

Article 56
To the fullest extent of the means available to it, the Occupying Power has
the duty of ensuring and maintaining, with the co-operation of national and
local authorities, the medical and hospital establishments and services, public
health and hygiene in the occupied territory, with particular reference to the
adoption and application of the prophylactic and preventive measures necessary to combat the spread of contagious diseases and epidemics. Medical
personnel of all categories shall be allowed to carry out their duties.
If new hospitals are set up in occupied territory and if the competent organs
of the occupied State are not operating there, the occupying authorities shall,
if necessary, grant them the recognition provided for in Article 18. In similar
circumstances, the occupying authorities shall also grant recognition to hospital personnel and transport vehicles under the provisions of Articles 20 and 21.
In adopting measures of health and hygiene and in their implementation, the
Occupying Power shall take into consideration the moral and ethical susceptibilities of the population of the occupied territory.
Article 57
The Occupying Power may requisition civilian hospitals only temporarily and
only in cases of urgent necessity for the care of military wounded and sick,
and then on condition that suitable arrangements are made in due time for
the care and treatment of the patients and for the needs of the civilian population for hospital accommodation.
The material and stores of civilian hospitals cannot be requisitioned so long as
they are necessary for the needs of the civilian population.
Article 58
The Occupying Power shall permit ministers of religion to give spiritual assistance to the members of their religious communities.
The Occupying Power shall also accept consignments of books and articles

If the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately
supplied, the Occupying Power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the
said population, and shall facilitate them by all the means at its disposal.
Such schemes, which may be undertaken either by States or by impartial humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red
Cross, shall consist, in particular, of the provision of consignments of foodstuffs, medical supplies and clothing.

Distribution
All Contracting Parties shall permit the free passage of these consignments
and shall guarantee their protection.
A Power granting free passage to consignments on their way to territory occupied by an adverse Party to the conflict shall, however, have the right to
search the consignments, to regulate their passage according to prescribed
times and routes, and to be reasonably satisfied through the Protecting Power
that these consignments are to be used for the relief of the needy population
and are not to be used for the benefit of the Occupying Power.
Article 60
Relief consignments shall in no way relieve the Occupying Power of any of its
responsibilities under Articles 55, 56 and 59. The Occupying Power shall in no
way whatsoever divert relief consignments from the purpose for which they
are intended, except in cases of urgent necessity, in the interests of the population of the occupied territory and with the consent of the Protecting Power.
Article 61
The distribution of the relief consignments referred to in the foregoing Articles shall be carried out with the co-operation and under the supervision of
the Protecting Power. This duty may also be delegated, by agreement between
the Occupying Power and the Protecting Power, to a neutral Power, to the
International Committee of the Red Cross or to any other impartial humanitarian body.
Such consignments shall be exempt in occupied territory from all charges,
taxes or customs duties unless these are necessary in the interests of the economy of the territory. The Occupying Power shall facilitate the rapid distribution of these consignments.
All Contracting Parties shall endeavour to permit the transit and transport,
free of charge, of such relief consignments on their way to occupied territories.
Article 62
Subject to imperative reasons of security, protected persons in occupied territories shall be permitted to receive the individual relief consignments sent
to them.
Article 63
Subject to temporary and exceptional measures imposed for urgent reasons
of security by the Occupying Power:

b) the Occupying Power may not require any changes in the personnel
or structure of these societies, which would prejudice the aforesaid
activities.
The same principles shall apply to the activities and personnel of special organizations of a non-military character, which already exist or which may be
established, for the purpose of ensuring the living conditions of the civilian
population by the maintenance of the essential public utility services, by the
distribution of relief and by the organization of rescues.
Article 64
The penal laws of the occupied territory shall remain in force, with the exception that they may be repealed or suspended by the Occupying Power in cases
where they constitute a threat to its security or an obstacle to the application
of the present Convention. Subject to the latter consideration and to the necessity for ensuring the effective administration of justice, the tribunals of the
occupied territory shall continue to function in respect of all offences covered
by the said laws.
The Occupying Power may, however, subject the population of the occupied
territory to provisions which are essential to enable the Occupying Power to
fulfil its obligations under the present Convention, to maintain the orderly government of the territory, and to ensure the security of the Occupying Power,
of the members and property of the occupying forces or administration, and
likewise of the establishments and lines of communication used by them.
Article 65
The penal provisions enacted by the Occupying Power shall not come into
force before they have been published and brought to the knowledge of the
inhabitants in their own language. The effect of these penal provisions shall
not be retroactive.
Article 66
In case of a breach of the penal provisions promulgated by it by virtue of the
second paragraph of Article 64, the Occupying Power may hand over the accused to its properly constituted, non-political military courts, on condition
that the said courts sit in the occupied country. Courts of appeal shall preferably sit in the occupied country.

offence. They shall take into consideration the fact that the accused is not a
national of the Occupying Power.
Article 68
Protected persons who commit an offence which is solely intended to harm
the Occupying Power, but which does not constitute an attempt on the life or
limb of members of the occupying forces or administration, nor a grave collective danger, nor seriously damage the property of the occupying forces or
administration or the installations used by them, shall be liable to internment
or simple imprisonment, provided the duration of such internment or imprisonment is proportionate to the offence committed. Furthermore, internment or imprisonment shall, for such offences, be the only measure adopted
for depriving protected persons of liberty. The courts provided for under Article 66 of the present Convention may at their discretion convert a sentence
of imprisonment to one of internment for the same period.
The penal provisions promulgated by the Occupying Power in accordance
with Articles 64 and 65 may impose the death penalty on a protected person
only in cases where the person is guilty of espionage, of serious acts of sabotage against the military installations of the Occupying Power or of intentional offences which have caused the death of one or more persons, provided
that such offences were punishable by death under the law of the occupied
territory in force before the occupation began.
The death penalty may not be pronounced against a protected person unless
the attention of the court has been particularly called to the fact that since the
accused is not a national of the Occupying Power, he is not bound to it by any
duty of allegiance.
In any case, the death penalty may not be pronounced against a protected
person who was under eighteen years of age at the time of the offence.
Article 69
In all cases, the duration of the period during which a protected person accused of an offence is under arrest awaiting trial or punishment shall be deducted from any period of imprisonment awarded.
Article 70
Protected persons shall not be arrested, prosecuted or convicted by the
Occupying Power for acts committed or for opinions expressed before the
occupation, or during a temporary interruption thereof, with the exception
of breaches of the laws and customs of war.

174 FOURTH CONVENTION
Nationals of the Occupying Power who, before the outbreak of hostilities,
have sought refuge in the territory of the occupied State, shall not be arrested,
prosecuted, convicted or deported from the occupied territory, except for offences committed after the outbreak of hostilities, or for offences under common law committed before the outbreak of hostilities which, according to the
law of the occupied State, would have justified extradition in time of peace.
Article 71
No sentence shall be pronounced by the competent courts of the Occupying
Power except after a regular trial.
Accused persons who are prosecuted by the Occupying Power shall be
promptly informed, in writing, in a language which they understand, of
the particulars of the charges preferred against them, and shall be brought
to trial as rapidly as possible. The Protecting Power shall be informed of all
proceedings instituted by the Occupying Power against protected persons in
respect of charges involving the death penalty or imprisonment for two years
or more; it shall be enabled, at any time, to obtain information regarding the
state of such proceedings. Furthermore, the Protecting Power shall be entitled, on request, to be furnished with all particulars of these and of any other
proceedings instituted by the Occupying Power against protected persons.
The notification to the Protecting Power, as provided for in the second
paragraph above, shall be sent immediately, and shall in any case reach the
Protecting Power three weeks before the date of the first hearing. Unless,
at the opening of the trial, evidence is submitted that the provisions of this
Article are fully complied with, the trial shall not proceed. The notification
shall include the following particulars:
a) description of the accused;
b) place of residence or detention;
c) specification of the charge or charges (with mention of the penal provisions under which it is brought);
d) designation of the court which will hear the case;
e) place and date of the first hearing.
Article 72
Accused persons shall have the right to present evidence necessary to their
defence and may, in particular, call witnesses. They shall have the right to be
assisted by a qualified advocate or counsel of their own choice, who shall be
able to visit them freely and shall enjoy the necessary facilities for preparing
the defence.

an interpreter, both during preliminary investigation and during the hearing
in court. They shall have the right at any time to object to the interpreter and
to ask for his replacement.
Article 73
A convicted person shall have the right of appeal provided for by the laws applied by the court. He shall be fully informed of his right to appeal or petition
and of the time limit within which he may do so.
The penal procedure provided in the present Section shall apply, as far as it
is applicable, to appeals. Where the laws applied by the court make no provision for appeals, the convicted person shall have the right to petition against
the finding and sentence to the competent authority of the Occupying Power.
Article 74
Representatives of the Protecting Power shall have the right to attend the trial
of any protected person, unless the hearing has, as an exceptional measure,
to be held in camera in the interests of the security of the Occupying Power,
which shall then notify the Protecting Power. A notification in respect of the
date and place of trial shall be sent to the Protecting Power.
Any judgment involving a sentence of death, or imprisonment for two years
or more, shall be communicated, with the relevant grounds, as rapidly as possible to the Protecting Power. The notification shall contain a reference to the
notification made under Article 71, and, in the case of sentences of imprisonment, the name of the place where the sentence is to be served. A record of
judgments other than those referred to above shall be kept by the court and
shall be open to inspection by representatives of the Protecting Power. Any
period allowed for appeal in the case of sentences involving the death penalty, or imprisonment of two years or more, shall not run until notification of
judgment has been received by the Protecting Power.
Article 75
In no case shall persons condemned to death be deprived of the right of petition for pardon or reprieve.
No death sentence shall be carried out before the expiration of a period of at
least six months from the date of receipt by the Protecting Power of the notification of the final judgment confirming such death sentence, or of an order
denying pardon or reprieve.
V. Death
sentence
176 FOURTH CONVENTION
The six months period of suspension of the death sentence herein prescribed
may be reduced in individual cases in circumstances of grave emergency involving an organized threat to the security of the Occupying Power or its
forces, provided always that the Protecting Power is notified of such reduction and is given reasonable time and opportunity to make representations
to the competent occupying authorities in respect of such death sentences.
Article 76
Protected persons accused of offences shall be detained in the occupied country, and if convicted they shall serve their sentences therein. They shall, if
possible, be separated from other detainees and shall enjoy conditions of food
and hygiene which will be sufficient to keep them in good health, and which
will be at least equal to those obtaining in prisons in the occupied country.
They shall receive the medical attention required by their state of health.
They shall also have the right to receive any spiritual assistance which they
may require.
Women shall be confined in separate quarters and shall be under the direct
supervision of women.
Proper regard shall be paid to the special treatment due to minors.
Protected persons who are detained shall have the right to be visited by delegates of the Protecting Power and of the International Committee of the Red
Cross, in accordance with the provisions of Article 143.
Such persons shall have the right to receive at least one relief parcel monthly.
Article 77
Protected persons who have been accused of offences or convicted by the
courts in occupied territory, shall be handed over at the close of occupation,
with the relevant records, to the authorities of the liberated territory.
Article 78
If the Occupying Power considers it necessary, for imperative reasons of security, to take safety measures concerning protected persons, it may, at the most,
subject them to assigned residence or to internment.
Decisions regarding such assigned residence or internment shall be made according to a regular procedure to be prescribed by the Occupying Power in
accordance with the provisions of the present Convention. This procedure
shall include the right of appeal for the parties concerned. Appeals shall be
decided with the least possible delay. In the event of the decision being upheld, it shall be subject to periodical review, if possible every six months, by a
competent body set up by the said Power.

CHAPTER I
General Provisions
Article 79
The Parties to the conflict shall not intern protected persons, except in accordance with the provisions of Articles 41, 42, 43, 68 and 78.
Article 80
Internees shall retain their full civil capacity and shall exercise such attendant
rights as may be compatible with their status.
Article 81
Parties to the conflict who intern protected persons shall be bound to provide
free of charge for their maintenance, and to grant them also the medical attention required by their state of health.
No deduction from the allowances, salaries or credits due to the internees
shall be made for the repayment of these costs.
The Detaining Power shall provide for the support of those dependent on the
internees, if such dependents are without adequate means of support or are
unable to earn a living.
Article 82
The Detaining Power shall, as far as possible, accommodate the internees
according to their nationality, language and customs. Internees who are nationals of the same country shall not be separated merely because they have
different languages.
Throughout the duration of their internment, members of the same family,
and in particular parents and children, shall be lodged together in the same
place of internment, except when separation of a temporary nature is necessitated for reasons of employment or health or for the purposes of enforcement of the provisions of Chapter IX of the present Section. Internees may
request that their children who are left at liberty without parental care shall
be interned with them.
Grouping of
internees
178 FOURTH CONVENTION
Wherever possible, interned members of the same family shall be housed in
the same premises and given separate accommodation from other internees,
together with facilities for leading a proper family life.
CHAPTER II
Places of Internment
Article 83
The Detaining Power shall not set up places of internment in areas particularly exposed to the dangers of war.
The Detaining Power shall give the enemy Powers, through the intermediary
of the Protecting Powers, all useful information regarding the geographical
location of places of internment.
Whenever military considerations permit, internment camps shall be indicated by the letters IC, placed so as to be clearly visible in the daytime from
the air. The Powers concerned may, however, agree upon any other system of
marking. No place other than an internment camp shall be marked as such.
Article 84
Internees shall be accommodated and administered separately from prisoners of war and from persons deprived of liberty for any other reason.
Article 85
The Detaining Power is bound to take all necessary and possible measures
to ensure that protected persons shall, from the outset of their internment,
be accommodated in buildings or quarters which afford every possible safeguard as regards hygiene and health, and provide efficient protection against
the rigours of the climate and the effects of the war. In no case shall permanent places of internment be situated in unhealthy areas or in districts the
climate of which is injurious to the internees. In all cases where the district,
in which a protected person is temporarily interned, is in an unhealthy area
or has a climate which is harmful to his health, he shall be removed to a more
suitable place of internment as rapidly as circumstances permit.
The premises shall be fully protected from dampness, adequately heated and
lighted, in particular between dusk and lights out. The sleeping quarters shall
be sufficiently spacious and well ventilated, and the internees shall have suitable bedding and sufficient blankets, account being taken of the climate, and
the age, sex, and state of health of the internees.
Internees shall have for their use, day and night, sanitary conveniences which
conform to the rules of hygiene and are constantly maintained in a state of

and for cleaning.
Whenever it is necessary, as an exceptional and temporary measure, to accommodate women internees who are not members of a family unit in the same
place of internment as men, the provision of separate sleeping quarters and
sanitary conveniences for the use of such women internees shall be obligatory.
Article 86
The Detaining Power shall place at the disposal of interned persons, of whatever denomination, premises suitable for the holding of their religious services.
Article 87
Canteens shall be installed in every place of internment, except where other
suitable facilities are available. Their purpose shall be to enable internees to
make purchases, at prices not higher than local market prices, of foodstuffs
and articles of everyday use, including soap and tobacco, such as would increase their personal well-being and comfort.
Profits made by canteens shall be credited to a welfare fund to be set up for each
place of internment, and administered for the benefit of the internees attached
to such place of internment. The Internee Committee provided for in Article 102
shall have the right to check the management of the canteen and of the said fund.
When a place of internment is closed down, the balance of the welfare fund
shall be transferred to the welfare fund of a place of internment for internees
of the same nationality, or, if such a place does not exist, to a central welfare
fund which shall be administered for the benefit of all internees remaining
in the custody of the Detaining Power. In case of a general release, the said
profits shall be kept by the Detaining Power, subject to any agreement to the
contrary between the Powers concerned.
Article 88
In all places of internment exposed to air raids and other hazards of war,
shelters adequate in number and structure to ensure the necessary protection
shall be installed. In case of alarms, the internees shall be free to enter such
shelters as quickly as possible, excepting those who remain for the protection
of their quarters against the aforesaid hazards. Any protective measures taken
in favour of the population shall also apply to them.
All due precautions must be taken in places of internment against the danger

Food and Clothing
Article 89
Daily food rations for internees shall be sufficient in quantity, quality and variety to keep internees in a good state of health and prevent the development
of nutritional deficiencies. Account shall also be taken of the customary diet
of the internees.
Internees shall also be given the means by which they can prepare for themselves any additional food in their possession.
Sufficient drinking water shall be supplied to internees. The use of tobacco
shall be permitted.
Internees who work shall receive additional rations in proportion to the kind
of labour which they perform.
Expectant and nursing mothers and children under fifteen years of age shall
be given additional food, in proportion to their physiological needs.
Article 90
When taken into custody, internees shall be given all facilities to provide themselves with the necessary clothing, footwear and change of underwear, and later
on, to procure further supplies if required. Should any internees not have sufficient clothing, account being taken of the climate, and be unable to procure
any, it shall be provided free of charge to them by the Detaining Power.
The clothing supplied by the Detaining Power to internees and the outward
markings placed on their own clothes shall not be ignominious nor expose
them to ridicule.
Workers shall receive suitable working outfits, including protective clothing,
whenever the nature of their work so requires.
CHAPTER IV
Hygiene and Medical Attention
Article 91
Every place of internment shall have an adequate infirmary, under the direction of a qualified doctor, where internees may have the attention they
require, as well as an appropriate diet. Isolation wards shall be set aside for
cases of contagious or mental diseases.

Internees shall, for preference, have the attention of medical personnel of
their own nationality.
Internees may not be prevented from presenting themselves to the medical
authorities for examination. The medical authorities of the Detaining Power
shall, upon request, issue to every internee who has undergone treatment an
official certificate showing the nature of his illness or injury, and the duration
and nature of the treatment given. A duplicate of this certificate shall be forwarded to the Central Agency provided for in Article 140.
Treatment, including the provision of any apparatus necessary for the maintenance of internees in good health, particularly dentures and other artificial
appliances and spectacles, shall be free of charge to the internee.
Article 92
Medical inspections of internees shall be made at least once a month. Their
purpose shall be, in particular, to supervise the general state of health, nutrition and cleanliness of internees, and to detect contagious diseases, especially
tuberculosis, malaria, and venereal diseases. Such inspections shall include,
in particular, the checking of weight of each internee and, at least once a year,
radioscopic examination.
CHAPTER V
Religious, Intellectual and Physical Activities
Article 93
Internees shall enjoy complete latitude in the exercise of their religious duties, including attendance at the services of their faith, on condition that they
comply with the disciplinary routine prescribed by the detaining authorities.
Ministers of religion who are interned shall be allowed to minister freely to
the members of their community. For this purpose, the Detaining Power shall
ensure their equitable allocation amongst the various places of internment in
which there are internees speaking the same language and belonging to the
same religion. Should such ministers be too few in number, the Detaining
Power shall provide them with the necessary facilities, including means of
transport, for moving from one place to another, and they shall be authorized
to visit any internees who are in hospital. Ministers of religion shall be at
liberty to correspond on matters concerning their ministry with the religious
authorities in the country of detention and, as far as possible, with the international religious organizations of their faith. Such correspondence shall
182 FOURTH CONVENTION
not be considered as forming a part of the quota mentioned in Article 107. It
shall, however, be subject to the provisions of Article 112.
When internees do not have at their disposal the assistance of ministers of
their faith, or should these latter be too few in number, the local religious
authorities of the same faith may appoint, in agreement with the Detaining
Power, a minister of the internees’ faith or, if such a course is feasible from
a denominational point of view, a minister of similar religion or a qualified
layman. The latter shall enjoy the facilities granted to the ministry he has assumed. Persons so appointed shall comply with all regulations laid down by
the Detaining Power in the interests of discipline and security.
Article 94
The Detaining Power shall encourage intellectual, educational and recreational pursuits, sports and games amongst internees, whilst leaving them free
to take part in them or not. It shall take all practicable measures to ensure the
exercise thereof, in particular by providing suitable premises.
All possible facilities shall be granted to internees to continue their studies
or to take up new subjects. The education of children and young people shall
be ensured; they shall be allowed to attend schools either within the place of
internment or outside.
Internees shall be given opportunities for physical exercise, sports and outdoor games. For this purpose, sufficient open spaces shall be set aside in all
places of internment. Special playgrounds shall be reserved for children and
young people.
Article 95
The Detaining Power shall not employ internees as workers, unless they so
desire. Employment which, if undertaken under compulsion by a protected
person not in internment, would involve a breach of Articles 40 or 51 of the
present Convention, and employment on work which is of a degrading or
humiliating character are in any case prohibited.
After a working period of six weeks, internees shall be free to give up work at
any moment, subject to eight days’ notice.
These provisions constitute no obstacle to the right of the Detaining Power
to employ interned doctors, dentists and other medical personnel in their
professional capacity on behalf of their fellow internees, or to employ internees for administrative and maintenance work in places of internment and to
detail such persons for work in the kitchens or for other domestic tasks, or
to require such persons to undertake duties connected with the protection of
internees against aerial bombardment or other war risks. No internee may,

however, be required to perform tasks for which he is, in the opinion of a
medical officer, physically unsuited.
The Detaining Power shall take entire responsibility for all working conditions, for medical attention, for the payment of wages, and for ensuring that
all employed internees receive compensation for occupational accidents and
diseases. The standards prescribed for the said working conditions and for
compensation shall be in accordance with the national laws and regulations,
and with the existing practice; they shall in no case be inferior to those obtaining for work of the same nature in the same district. Wages for work done
shall be determined on an equitable basis by special agreements between the
internees, the Detaining Power, and, if the case arises, employers other than
the Detaining Power, due regard being paid to the obligation of the Detaining
Power to provide for free maintenance of internees and for the medical attention which their state of health may require. Internees permanently detailed
for categories of work mentioned in the third paragraph of this Article shall
be paid fair wages by the Detaining Power. The working conditions and the
scale of compensation for occupational accidents and diseases to internees,
thus detailed, shall not be inferior to those applicable to work of the same
nature in the same district.
Article 96
All labour detachments shall remain part of and dependent upon a place of
internment. The competent authorities of the Detaining Power and the commandant of a place of internment shall be responsible for the observance in
a labour detachment of the provisions of the present Convention. The commandant shall keep an up-to-date list of the labour detachments subordinate
to him and shall communicate it to the delegates of the Protecting Power,
of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of other humanitarian
organizations who may visit the places of internment.
CHAPTER VI
Personal Property and Financial Resources
Article 97
Internees shall be permitted to retain articles of personal use. Monies,
cheques, bonds, etc., and valuables in their possession may not be taken from
them except in accordance with established procedure. Detailed receipts shall
be given therefor.
The amounts shall be paid into the account of every internee as provided for
in Article 98. Such amounts may not be converted into any other currency
Valuables
and personal
effects
184 FOURTH CONVENTION
unless legislation in force in the territory in which the owner is interned so
requires or the internee gives his consent.
Articles which have above all a personal or sentimental value may not be
taken away.
A woman internee shall not be searched except by a woman.
On release or repatriation, internees shall be given all articles, monies or other valuables taken from them during internment and shall receive in currency
the balance of any credit to their accounts kept in accordance with Article 98,
with the exception of any articles or amounts withheld by the Detaining
Power by virtue of its legislation in force. If the property of an internee is so
withheld, the owner shall receive a detailed receipt.
Family or identity documents in the possession of internees may not be taken
away without a receipt being given. At no time shall internees be left without identity documents. If they have none, they shall be issued with special
documents drawn up by the detaining authorities, which will serve as their
identity papers until the end of their internment.
Internees may keep on their persons a certain amount of money, in cash or in
the shape of purchase coupons, to enable them to make purchases.
Article 98
All internees shall receive regular allowances, sufficient to enable them to
purchase goods and articles, such as tobacco, toilet requisites, etc. Such allowances may take the form of credits or purchase coupons.
Furthermore, internees may receive allowances from the Power to which they
owe allegiance, the Protecting Powers, the organizations which may assist them,
or their families, as well as the income on their property in accordance with the
law of the Detaining Power. The amount of allowances granted by the Power
to which they owe allegiance shall be the same for each category of internees
(infirm, sick, pregnant women, etc.), but may not be allocated by that Power
or distributed by the Detaining Power on the basis of discriminations between
internees which are prohibited by Article 27 of the present Convention.
The Detaining Power shall open a regular account for every internee, to which
shall be credited the allowances named in the present Article, the wages earned
and the remittances received, together with such sums taken from him as may
be available under the legislation in force in the territory in which he is interned. Internees shall be granted all facilities consistent with the legislation in
force in such territory to make remittances to their families and to other dependants. They may draw from their accounts the amounts necessary for their
personal expenses, within the limits fixed by the Detaining Power. They shall
at all times be afforded reasonable facilities for consulting and obtaining copies

Administration and Discipline
Article 99
Every place of internment shall be put under the authority of a responsible
officer, chosen from the regular military forces or the regular civil administration of the Detaining Power. The officer in charge of the place of internment
must have in his possession a copy of the present Convention in the official
language, or one of the official languages, of his country and shall be responsible for its application. The staff in control of internees shall be instructed in
the provisions of the present Convention and of the administrative measures
adopted to ensure its application.
The text of the present Convention and the texts of special agreements concluded under the said Convention shall be posted inside the place of internment, in a language which the internees understand, or shall be in the
possession of the Internee Committee.
Regulations, orders, notices and publications of every kind shall be communicated to the internees and posted inside the places of internment, in a language which they understand.
Every order and command addressed to internees individually must likewise
be given in a language which they understand.
Article 100
The disciplinary regime in places of internment shall be consistent with humanitarian principles, and shall in no circumstances include regulations
imposing on internees any physical exertion dangerous to their health or
involving physical or moral victimization. Identification by tattooing or imprinting signs or markings on the body, is prohibited.
In particular, prolonged standing and roll-calls, punishment drill, military
drill and manœuvres, or the reduction of food rations, are prohibited.
Article 101
Internees shall have the right to present to the authorities in whose power
they are, any petition with regard to the conditions of internment to which
they are subjected.
They shall also have the right to apply without restriction through the Internee
Committee or, if they consider it necessary, direct to the representatives of the
Complaints
and petitions
186 FOURTH CONVENTION
Protecting Power, in order to indicate to them any points on which they may
have complaints to make with regard to the conditions of internment.
Such petitions and complaints shall be transmitted forthwith and without alteration, and even if the latter are recognized to be unfounded, they may not
occasion any punishment.
Periodic reports on the situation in places of internment and as to the needs
of the internees may be sent by the Internee Committees to the representatives of the Protecting Powers.
Article 102
In every place of internment, the internees shall freely elect by secret ballot
every six months, the members of a Committee empowered to represent them
before the Detaining and the Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross and any other organization which may assist them. The
members of the Committee shall be eligible for re-election.
Internees so elected shall enter upon their duties after their election has been
approved by the detaining authorities. The reasons for any refusals or dismissals shall be communicated to the Protecting Powers concerned.
Article 103
The Internee Committees shall further the physical, spiritual and intellectual
well-being of the internees.
In case the internees decide, in particular, to organize a system of mutual
assistance amongst themselves, this organization would be within the competence of the Committees in addition to the special duties entrusted to them
under other provisions of the present Convention.
Article 104
Members of Internee Committees shall not be required to perform any other
work, if the accomplishment of their duties is rendered more difficult thereby.
Members of Internee Committees may appoint from amongst the internees
such assistants as they may require. All material facilities shall be granted to
them, particularly a certain freedom of movement necessary for the accomplishment of their duties (visits to labour detachments, receipt of supplies, etc.).
All facilities shall likewise be accorded to members of Internee Committees
for communication by post and telegraph with the detaining authorities,
the Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross and
their delegates, and with the organizations which give assistance to internees, Committee members in labour detachments shall enjoy similar facilities for communication with their Internee Committee in the principal place

CHAPTER VIII
Relations with the Exterior
Article 105
Immediately upon interning protected persons, the Detaining Powers shall
inform them, the Power to which they owe allegiance and their Protecting Power of the measures taken for executing the provisions of the present
Chapter. The Detaining Powers shall likewise inform the Parties concerned of
any subsequent modifications of such measures.
Article 106
As soon as he is interned, or at the latest not more than one week after his arrival in a place of internment, and likewise in cases of sickness or transfer to
another place of internment or to a hospital, every internee shall be enabled
to send direct to his family, on the one hand, and to the Central Agency provided for by Article 140, on the other, an internment card similar, if possible,
to the model annexed to the present Convention, informing his relatives of
his detention, address and state of health. The said cards shall be forwarded
as rapidly as possible and may not be delayed in any way.
Article 107
Internees shall be allowed to send and receive letters and cards. If the Detaining Power deems it necessary to limit the number of letters and cards sent by
each internee, the said number shall not be less than two letters and four cards
monthly; these shall be drawn up so as to conform as closely as possible to the
models annexed to the present Convention. If limitations must be placed on
the correspondence addressed to internees, they may be ordered only by the
Power to which such internees owe allegiance, possibly at the request of the
Detaining Power. Such letters and cards must be conveyed with reasonable
despatch; they may not be delayed or retained for disciplinary reasons.
Internees who have been a long time without news, or who find it impossible
to receive news from their relatives, or to give them news by the ordinary
postal route, as well as those who are at a considerable distance from their
homes, shall be allowed to send telegrams, the charges being paid by them in
the currency at their disposal. They shall likewise benefit by this provision in
cases which are recognized to be urgent.
188 FOURTH CONVENTION
As a rule, internees’ mail shall be written in their own language. The Parties to
the conflict may authorize correspondence in other languages.
Article 108
Internees shall be allowed to receive, by post or by any other means, individual
parcels or collective shipments containing in particular foodstuffs, clothing,
medical supplies, as well as books and objects of a devotional, educational or
recreational character which may meet their needs. Such shipments shall in
no way free the Detaining Power from the obligations imposed upon it by
virtue of the present Convention.
Should military necessity require the quantity of such shipments to be limited, due notice thereof shall be given to the Protecting Power and to the
International Committee of the Red Cross, or to any other organization giving assistance to the internees and responsible for the forwarding of such
shipments.
The conditions for the sending of individual parcels and collective shipments
shall, if necessary, be the subject of special agreements between the Powers
concerned, which may in no case delay the receipt by the internees of relief
supplies. Parcels of clothing and foodstuffs may not include books. Medical
relief supplies shall, as a rule, be sent in collective parcels.
Article 109
In the absence of special agreements between Parties to the conflict regarding
the conditions for the receipt and distribution of collective relief shipments,
the regulations concerning collective relief which are annexed to the present
Convention shall be applied.
The special agreements provided for above shall in no case restrict the right
of Internee Committees to take possession of collective relief shipments intended for internees, to undertake their distribution and to dispose of them
in the interests of the recipients.
Nor shall such agreements restrict the right of representatives of the Protecting
Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross, or any other organization giving assistance to internees and responsible for the forwarding of collective shipments, to supervise their distribution to the recipients.
Article 110
All relief shipments for internees shall be exempt from import, customs and
other dues.

countries of origin and destination and in intermediate countries. To this end,
in particular, the exemption provided by the Universal Postal Convention of
1947 and by the agreements of the Universal Postal Union in favour of civilians of enemy nationality detained in camps or civilian prisons, shall be
extended to the other interned persons protected by the present Convention.
The countries not signatory to the above-mentioned agreements shall be
bound to grant freedom from charges in the same circumstances.
The cost of transporting relief shipments which are intended for internees and
which, by reason of their weight or any other cause, cannot be sent through
the post office, shall be borne by the Detaining Power in all the territories
under its control. Other Powers which are Parties to the present Convention
shall bear the cost of transport in their respective territories.
Costs connected with the transport of such shipments, which are not covered
by the above paragraphs, shall be charged to the senders.
The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to reduce, so far as possible,
the charges for telegrams sent by internees, or addressed to them.
Article 111
Should military operations prevent the Powers concerned from fulfilling their
obligation to ensure the conveyance of the mail and relief shipments provided for
in Articles 106,107, 108 and 113, the Protecting Powers concerned, the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other organization duly approved by
the Parties to the conflict may undertake the conveyance of such shipments by
suitable means (rail, motor vehicles, vessels or aircraft, etc.). For this purpose, the
High Contracting Parties shall endeavour to supply them with such transport,
and to allow its circulation, especially by granting the necessary safe-conducts.
Such transport may also be used to convey:
a) correspondence, lists and reports exchanged between the Central
Information Agency referred to in Article 140 and the National Bureaux referred to in Article 136;
b) correspondence and reports relating to internees which the Protecting Powers, the International Committee of the Red Cross or any
other organization assisting the internees exchange either with their
own delegates or with the Parties to the conflict.
These provisions in no way detract from the right of any Party to the conflict
to arrange other means of transport if it should so prefer, nor preclude the
granting of safe-conducts, under mutually agreed conditions, to such means
of transport.
190 FOURTH CONVENTION
The costs occasioned by the use of such means of transport shall be borne, in
proportion to the importance of the shipments, by the Parties to the conflict
whose nationals are benefited thereby.
Article 112
The censoring of correspondence addressed to internees or despatched by
them shall be done as quickly as possible.
The examination of consignments intended for internees shall not be carried
out under conditions that will expose the goods contained in them to deterioration. It shall be done in the presence of the addressee, or of a fellow-internee
duly delegated by him. The delivery to internees of individual or collective consignments shall not be delayed under the pretext of difficulties of censorship.
Any prohibition of correspondence ordered by the Parties to the conflict either for military or political reasons, shall be only temporary and its duration
shall be as short as possible.
Article 113
The Detaining Powers shall provide all reasonable facilities for the transmission, through the Protecting Power or the Central Agency provided for in
Article 140, or as otherwise required, of wills, powers of attorney, letters of authority, or any other documents intended for internees or despatched by them.
In all cases the Detaining Powers shall facilitate the execution and authentication in due legal form of such documents on behalf of internees, in particular
by allowing them to consult a lawyer.
Article 114
The Detaining Power shall afford internees all facilities to enable them to
manage their property, provided this is not incompatible with the conditions
of internment and the law which is applicable. For this purpose, the said Power may give them permission to leave the place of internment in urgent cases
and if circumstances allow.
Article 115
In all cases where an internee is a party to proceedings in any court, the Detaining Power shall, if he so requests, cause the court to be informed of his
detention and shall, within legal limits, ensure that all necessary steps are
taken to prevent him from being in any way prejudiced, by reason of his internment, as regards the preparation and conduct of his case or as regards the
execution of any judgment of the court.

cases, particularly in cases of death or serious illness of relatives.
CHAPTER IX
Penal and Disciplinary Sanctions
Article 117
Subject to the provisions of the present Chapter, the laws in force in the territory in which they are detained will continue to apply to internees who commit offences during internment.
If general laws, regulations or orders declare acts committed by internees to be
punishable, whereas the same acts are not punishable when committed by persons who are not internees, such acts shall entail disciplinary punishments only.
No internee may be punished more than once for the same act, or on the
same count.
Article 118
The courts or authorities shall in passing sentence take as far as possible into
account the fact that the defendant is not a national of the Detaining Power.
They shall be free to reduce the penalty prescribed for the offence with which
the internee is charged and shall not be obliged, to this end, to apply the minimum sentence prescribed.
Imprisonment in premises without daylight, and, in general, all forms of cruelty without exception are forbidden.
Internees who have served disciplinary or judicial sentences shall not be
treated differently from other internees.
The duration of preventive detention undergone by an internee shall be deducted from any disciplinary or judicial penalty involving confinement to
which he may be sentenced.
Internee Committees shall be informed of all judicial proceedings instituted
against internees whom they represent, and of their result.
192 FOURTH CONVENTION
Article 119
The disciplinary punishments applicable to internees shall be the following:
1) A fine which shall not exceed 50 per cent of the wages which the internee
would otherwise receive under the provisions of Article 95 during a period of not more than thirty days.
2) Discontinuance of privileges granted over and above the treatment provided for by the present Convention.
3) Fatigue duties, not exceeding two hours daily, in connection with the
maintenance of the place of internment.
4) Confinement.
In no case shall disciplinary penalties be inhuman, brutal or dangerous for
the health of internees. Account shall be taken of the internee’s age, sex and
state of health.
The duration of any single punishment shall in no case exceed a maximum of
thirty consecutive days, even if the internee is answerable for several breaches
of discipline when his case is dealt with, whether such breaches are connected
or not.
Article 120
Internees who are recaptured after having escaped or when attempting to escape, shall be liable only to disciplinary punishment in respect of this act,
even if it is a repeated offence.
Article 118, paragraph 3, notwithstanding, internees punished as a result of
escape or attempt to escape, may be subjected to special surveillance, on condition that such surveillance does not affect the state of their health, that it is
exercised in a place of internment and that it does not entail the abolition of
any of the safeguards granted by the present Convention.
Internees who aid and abet an escape, or attempt to escape, shall be liable on
this count to disciplinary punishment only.
Article 121
Escape, or attempt to escape, even if it is a repeated offence, shall not be
deemed an aggravating circumstance in cases where an internee is prosecuted
for offences committed during his escape.
The Parties to the conflict shall ensure that the competent authorities exercise
leniency in deciding whether punishment inflicted for an offence shall be of a
disciplinary or judicial nature, especially in respect of acts committed in connection with an escape, whether successful or not.

Article 122
Acts which constitute offences against discipline shall be investigated immediately. This rule shall be applied, in particular, in cases of escape or attempt to
escape. Recaptured internees shall be handed over to the competent authorities as soon as possible.
In case of offences against discipline, confinement awaiting trial shall be reduced
to an absolute minimum for all internees, and shall not exceed fourteen days.
Its duration shall in any case be deducted from any sentence of confinement.
The provisions of Articles 124 and 125 shall apply to internees who are in
confinement awaiting trial for offences against discipline.
Article 123
Without prejudice to the competence of courts and higher authorities, disciplinary punishment may be ordered only by the commandant of the place
of internment, or by a responsible officer or official who replaces him, or to
whom he has delegated his disciplinary powers.
Before any disciplinary punishment is awarded, the accused internee shall be
given precise information regarding the offences of which he is accused, and
given an opportunity of explaining his conduct and of defending himself. He
shall be permitted, in particular, to call witnesses and to have recourse, if necessary, to the services of a qualified interpreter. The decision shall be announced
in the presence of the accused and of a member of the Internee Committee.
The period elapsing between the time of award of a disciplinary punishment
and its execution shall not exceed one month.
When an internee is awarded a further disciplinary punishment, a period of
at least three days shall elapse between the execution of any two of the punishments, if the duration of one of these is ten days or more.
A record of disciplinary punishments shall be maintained by the commandant of the place of internment and shall be open to inspection by representatives of the Protecting Power.
Article 124
Internees shall not in any case be transferred to penitentiary establishments
(prisons, penitentiaries, convict prisons, etc.) to undergo disciplinary punishment therein.
The premises in which disciplinary punishments are undergone shall conform to sanitary requirements; they shall in particular be provided with adequate bedding. Internees undergoing punishment shall be enabled to keep
themselves in a state of cleanliness.
194 FOURTH CONVENTION
Women internees undergoing disciplinary punishment shall be confined in
separate quarters from male internees and shall be under the immediate supervision of women.
Article 125
Internees awarded disciplinary punishment shall be allowed to exercise and
to stay in the open air at least two hours daily.
They shall be allowed, if they so request, to be present at the daily medical inspections. They shall receive the attention which their state of health requires
and, if necessary, shall be removed to the infirmary of the place of internment
or to a hospital.
They shall have permission to read and write, likewise to send and receive letters. Parcels and remittances of money, however, may be withheld from them
until the completion of their punishment; such consignments shall meanwhile be entrusted to the Internee Committee, who will hand over to the
infirmary the perishable goods contained in the parcels.
No internee given a disciplinary punishment may be deprived of the benefit
of the provisions of Articles 107 and 143 of the present Convention.
Article 126
The provisions of Articles 71 to 76 inclusive shall apply, by analogy, to proceedings against internees who are in the national territory of the Detaining Power.
CHAPTER X
Transfers of Internees
Article 127
The transfer of internees shall always be effected humanely. As a general rule,
it shall be carried out by rail or other means of transport, and under conditions at least equal to those obtaining for the forces of the Detaining Power
in their changes of station. If, as an exceptional measure, such removals have
to be effected on foot, they may not take place unless the internees are in a
fit state of health, and may not in any case expose them to excessive fatigue.
The Detaining Power shall supply internees during transfer with drinking
water and food sufficient in quantity, quality and variety to maintain them
in good health, and also with the necessary clothing, adequate shelter and
the necessary medical attention. The Detaining Power shall take all suitable
precautions to ensure their safety during transfer, and shall establish before
their departure a complete list of all internees transferred.

Sick, wounded or infirm internees and maternity cases shall not be transferred if the journey would be seriously detrimental to them, unless their
safety imperatively so demands.
If the combat zone draws close to a place of internment, the internees in the
said place shall not be transferred unless their removal can be carried out in
adequate conditions of safety, or unless they are exposed to greater risks by
remaining on the spot than by being transferred.
When making decisions regarding the transfer of internees, the Detaining
Power shall take their interests into account and, in particular, shall not do
anything to increase the difficulties of repatriating them or returning them to
their own homes.
Article 128
In the event of transfer, internees shall be officially advised of their departure
and of their new postal address. Such notification shall be given in time for
them to pack their luggage and inform their next of kin.
They shall be allowed to take with them their personal effects, and the correspondence and parcels which have arrived for them. The weight of such
baggage may be limited if the conditions of transfer so require, but in no case
to less than twenty-five kilograms per internee.
Mail and parcels addressed to their former place of internment shall be forwarded to them without delay.
The commandant of the place of internment shall take, in agreement with
the Internee Committee, any measures needed to ensure the transport of the
internees’ community property and of the luggage the internees are unable
to take with them in consequence of restrictions imposed by virtue of the
second paragraph.
CHAPTER XI
Deaths
Article 129
The wills of internees shall be received for safekeeping by the responsible authorities; and in the event of the death of an internee his will shall be transmitted without delay to a person whom he has previously designated.
Deaths of internees shall be certified in every case by a doctor, and a death
certificate shall be made out, showing the causes of death and the conditions
under which it occurred.
196 FOURTH CONVENTION
An official record of the death, duly registered, shall be drawn up in accordance with the procedure relating thereto in force in the territory where the
place of internment is situated, and a duly certified copy of such record shall
be transmitted without delay to the Protecting Power as well as to the Central
Agency referred to in Article 140.
Article 130
The detaining authorities shall ensure that internees who die while interned
are honourably buried, if possible according to the rites of the religion to
which they belonged and that their graves are respected, properly maintained,
and marked in such a way that they can always be recognized.
Deceased internees shall be buried in individual graves unless unavoidable
circumstances require the use of collective graves. Bodies may be cremated
only for imperative reasons of hygiene, on account of the religion of the deceased or in accordance with his expressed wish to this effect. In case of cremation, the fact shall be stated and the reasons given in the death certificate
of the deceased. The ashes shall be retained for safekeeping by the detaining
authorities and shall be transferred as soon as possible to the next of kin on
their request.
As soon as circumstances permit, and not later than the close of hostilities,
the Detaining Power shall forward lists of graves of deceased internees to the
Powers on whom the deceased internees depended, through the Information
Bureaux provided for in Article 136. Such lists shall include all particulars
necessary for the identification of the deceased internees, as well as the exact
location of their graves.
Article 131
Every death or serious injury of an internee, caused or suspected to have been
caused by a sentry, another internee or any other person, as well as any death
the cause of which is unknown, shall be immediately followed by an official
enquiry by the Detaining Power.
A communication on this subject shall be sent immediately to the Protecting
Power. The evidence of any witnesses shall be taken, and a report including
such evidence shall be prepared and forwarded to the said Protecting Power.
If the enquiry indicates the guilt of one or more persons, the Detaining Power
shall take all necessary steps to ensure the prosecution of the person or persons responsible.

Release, Repatriation and Accommodation in Neutral Countries
Article 132
Each interned person shall be released by the Detaining Power as soon as the
reasons which necessitated his internment no longer exist.
The Parties to the conflict shall, moreover, endeavour during the course of
hostilities, to conclude agreements for the release, the repatriation, the return
to places of residence or the accommodation in a neutral country of certain
classes of internees, in particular children, pregnant women and mothers
with infants and young children, wounded and sick, and internees who have
been detained for a long time.
Article 133
Internment shall cease as soon as possible after the close of hostilities.
Internees in the territory of a Party to the conflict, against whom penal
proceedings are pending for offences not exclusively subject to disciplinary
penalties, may be detained until the close of such proceedings and, if circumstances require, until the completion of the penalty. The same shall apply
to internees who have been previously sentenced to a punishment depriving
them of liberty.
By agreement between the Detaining Power and the Powers concerned, committees may be set up after the close of hostilities, or of the occupation of
territories, to search for dispersed internees.
Article 134
The High Contracting Parties shall endeavour, upon the close of hostilities
or occupation, to ensure the return of all internees to their last place of residence, or to facilitate their repatriation.
Article 135
The Detaining Power shall bear the expense of returning released internees
to the places where they were residing when interned, or, if it took them into
custody while they were in transit or on the high seas, the cost of completing
their journey or of their return to their point of departure.
Where a Detaining Power refuses permission to reside in its territory to a
released internee who previously had his permanent domicile therein, such
Detaining Power shall pay the cost of the said internee’s repatriation. If, however, the internee elects to return to his country on his own responsibility or
in obedience to the Government of the Power to which he owes allegiance,
the Detaining Power need not pay the expenses of his journey beyond the
During
hostilities or
occupation
198 FOURTH CONVENTION
point of his departure from its territory. The Detaining Power need not pay
the costs of repatriation of an internee who was interned at his own request.
If internees are transferred in accordance with Article 45, the transferring and
receiving Powers shall agree on the portion of the above costs to be borne by
each.
The foregoing shall not prejudice such special agreements as may be concluded between Parties to the conflict concerning the exchange and repatriation
of their nationals in enemy hands.
SECTION V
Information bureaux and central agency
Article 136
Upon the outbreak of a conflict and in all cases of occupation, each of the
Parties to the conflict shall establish an official Information Bureau responsible for receiving and transmitting information in respect of the protected

subjected to assigned residence or who are interned. It shall, furthermore,
require its various departments concerned with such matters to provide the
aforesaid Bureau promptly with information concerning all changes pertaining to these protected persons, as, for example, transfers, releases, repatriations, escapes, admittances to hospitals, births and deaths.
Article 137

aforesaid persons are nationals, or to Powers in whose territory they resided,
through the intermediary of the Protecting Powers and likewise through the
Central Agency provided for in Article 140. The Bureaux shall also reply to all
enquiries which may be received regarding protected persons.
Information Bureaux shall transmit information concerning a protected person unless its transmission might be detrimental to the person concerned
or to his or her relatives. Even in such a case, the information may not be
withheld from the Central Agency which, upon being notified of the circumstances, will take the necessary precautions indicated in Article 140.
All communications in writing made by any Bureau shall be authenticated by
a signature or a seal.

Article 142
Subject to the measures which the Detaining Powers may consider essential
to ensure their security or to meet any other reasonable need, the representatives of religious organizations, relief societies, or any other organizations assisting the protected persons, shall receive from these Powers, for themselves
or their duly accredited agents, all facilities for visiting the protected persons,

Each High Contracting Party shall be under the obligation to search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, such
grave breaches, and shall bring such persons, regardless of their nationality,

provisions of its own legislation, hand such persons over for trial to another
High Contracting Party concerned, provided such High Contracting Party
has made out a prima facie case.
Each High Contracting Party shall take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the provisions of the present Convention other
than the grave breaches defined in the following Article.
In all circumstances, the accused persons shall benefit by safeguards of proper trial and defence, which shall not be less favourable than those provided

DRAFT REGULATIONS
CONCERNIN G COLLECTIVE RELIEF
Article 1
The Internee Committees shall be allowed to distribute collective relief shipments for which
they are responsible, to all internees who are dependent for administration on the said Committee’s place of internment, including those internees who are in hospitals, or in prisons or
other penitentiary establishments.
Article 2
The distribution of collective relief shipments shall be effected in accordance with the instructions of the donors and with a plan drawn up by the Internee Committees. The issue of
medical stores shall, however, be made for preference in agreement with the senior medical
officers, and the latter may, in hospitals and infirmaries, waive the said instructions, if the
needs of their patients so demand. Within the limits thus defined, the distribution shall always be carried out equitably.
Article 3
Members of Internee Committees shall be allowed to go to the railway stations or other points
of arrival of relief supplies near their places of internment so as to enable them to verify the
quantity as well as the quality of the goods received and to make out detailed reports thereon
for the donors.
Article 4
Internee Committees shall be given the facilities necessary for verifying whether the distribution of collective relief in all sub-divisions and annexes of their places of internment has been
carried out in accordance with their instructions.
Article 5
Internee Committees shall be allowed to complete, and to cause to be completed by members
of the Internee Committees in labour detachments or by the senior medical officers of infirmaries and hospitals, forms or questionnaires intended for the donors, relating to collective
relief supplies (distribution, requirements, quantities, etc.). Such forms and questionnaires,
duly completed, shall be forwarded to the donors without delay.
Article 6
In order to secure the regular distribution of collective relief supplies to the internees in their
place of internment, and to meet any needs that may arise through the arrival of fresh parties of internees, the Internee Committees shall be allowed to create and maintain sufficient
210 FOURTH CONVENTION
reserve stocks of collective relief. For this purpose, they shall have suitable warehouses at their
disposal; each warehouse shall be provided with two locks, the Internee Committee holding
the keys of one lock, and the commandant of the place of internment the keys of the other.
Article 7
The High Contracting Parties, and the Detaining Powers in particular, shall, so far as is in any
way possible and subject to the regulations governing the food supply of the population, authorize purchases of goods to be made in their territories for the distribution of collective relief
to the internees. They shall likewise facilitate the transfer of funds and other financial measures
of a technical or administrative nature taken for the purpose of making such purchases.
Article 8
The foregoing provisions shall not constitute an obstacle to the right of internees to receive
collective relief before their arrival in a place of internment or in the course of their transfer,
nor to the possibility of representatives of the Protecting Power, or of the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other humanitarian organization giving assistance to internees
and responsible for forwarding such supplies, ensuring the distribution thereof to the recipients by any other means they may deem suitable.

GENEVA CONVENTION OF 1949 215
REsolutions
OF THE DI PLOMATIC CONFERENCE OF GENEVA , 1949
Resolution 1
The Conference recommends that, in the case of a dispute relating to the interpretation or
application of the present Conventions which cannot be settled by other means, the High
Contracting Parties concerned endeavour to agree between themselves to refer such dispute
to the International Court of Justice.
Resolution 2
Whereas circumstances may arise in the event of the outbreak of a future international conflict in which there will be no Protecting Power with whose cooperation and under whose
scrutiny the Conventions for the Protection of Victims of War can be applied; and
whereas Article 10 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the
Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949, Article 10 of the Geneva
Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked
Members of Armed Forces at Sea of August 12, 1949, Article 10 of the Geneva Convention
relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of August 12, 1949, and Article 11 of the Geneva
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of August 12, 1949,
provide that the High Contracting Parties may at any time agree to entrust to a body which offers all guarantees of impartiality and efficacy the duties incumbent on the Protecting Powers
by virtue of the aforesaid Conventions,
the Conference recommends that consideration be given as soon as possible to the advisability of setting up an international body, the functions of which shall be, in the absence of a
Protecting Power, to fulfil the duties performed by Protecting Powers in regard to the application of the Conventions for the Protection of War Victims.
Resolution 3
Whereas agreements may only with difficulty be concluded during hostilities;
whereas Article 28 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the
Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of August 12, 1949, provides that the Parties
to the conflict shall, during hostilities, make arrangements for relieving where possible retained personnel, and shall settle the procedure of such relief;
whereas Article 31 of the same Convention provides that, as from the outbreak of hostilities,
Parties to the conflict may determine by special arrangement the percentage of personnel to
be retained, in proportion to the number of prisoners and the distribution of the said personnel in the camps,
the Conference requests the International Committee of the Red Cross to prepare a model
agreement on the two questions referred to in the two Articles mentioned above and to submit it to the High Contracting Parties for their approval.
216 rEsolutions
Resolution 4
Whereas Article 33 of the Geneva Convention of July 27, 1929, for the Relief of the Wounded
and Sick in Armies in the Field, concerning the identity documents to be carried by medical
personnel, was only partially observed during the course of the recent war, thus creating serious difficulties for many members of such personnel,
the Conference recommends that States and National Red Cross Societies take all necessary
steps in time of peace to have medical personnel duly provided with the badges and identity
cards prescribed in Article 40 of the new Convention.
Resolution 5
Whereas misuse has frequently been made of the Red Cross emblem,
the Conference recommends that States take strict measures to ensure that the said emblem, as well as other emblems referred to in Article 38 of the Geneva Convention for the
Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field of
August 12, 1949, is used only within the limits prescribed by the Geneva Conventions, in
order to safeguard their authority and protect their high significance.
Resolution 6
Whereas the present Conference has not been able to raise the question of the technical study
of means of communication between hospital ships, on the one hand, and warships and military aircraft on the other, since that study went beyond its terms of reference;
whereas this question is of the greatest importance for the safety and efficient operation of
hospital ships,
the Conference recommends that the High Contracting Parties will, in the near future, instruct a Committee of Experts to examine technical improvements of modern means of communication between hospital ships, on the one hand, and warships and military aircraft, on
the other, and also to study the possibility of drawing up an International Code laying down
precise regulations for the use of those means, in order that hospital ships may be assured of
the maximum protection and be enabled to operate with the maximum efficiency.
Resolution 7
The Conference, being desirous of securing the maximum protection for hospital ships, expresses the hope that all High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed forces at
Sea of August 12, 1949, will arrange that, when ever conveniently practicable, such ships shall
frequently and regularly broadcast particulars of their position, route and speed.
GENEVA CONVENTION OF 1949 217
Resolution 8
The Conference wishes to affirm before all nations:
that, its work having been inspired solely by humanitarian aims, its earnest hope is that, in the
future, Governments may never have to apply the Geneva Conventions for the Protection of
War Victims;
that its strongest desire is that the Powers, great and small, may always reach a friendly settlement of their differences through cooperation and understanding between nations, so that
peace shall reign on earth for ever.
Resolution 9
Whereas Article 71 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War
of August 12, 1949, provides that prisoners of war who have been without news for a long
period, or who are unable to receive news from their next of kin or to give them news by the
ordinary postal route, as well as those who are at a great distance from their home, shall be
permitted to send telegrams, the fees being charged against the prisoners of war’s account
with the Detaining Power or paid in the currency at their disposal, and that prisoners of war
shall likewise benefit by these facilities in cases of urgency; and
whereas to reduce the cost, often prohibitive, of such telegrams or cables, it appears necessary
that some method of grouping messages should be introduced whereby a series of short specimen messages concerning personal health, health of relatives at home, schooling, finance, etc.,
could be drawn up and numbered, for use by prisoners of war in the aforesaid circumstances,
the Conference, therefore, requests the International Committee of the Red Cross to prepare
a series of specimen messages covering these requirements and to submit them to the High
Contracting Parties for their approval.
Resolution 10
The Conference considers that the conditions under which a Party to a conflict can be recognized as a belligerent by Powers not taking part in this conflict, are governed by the general
rules of international law on the subject and are in no way modified by the Geneva Conventions.
Resolution 11
Whereas the Geneva Conventions require the International Committee of the Red Cross to
be ready at all times and in all circumstances to fulfil the humanitarian tasks entrusted to it
